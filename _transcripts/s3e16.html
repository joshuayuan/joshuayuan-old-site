Betrayed all of us. <br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>raises head</i>) What can I do to make it up to you? <br><b>Katara</b>: You really want to know? (<i>walks towards Zuko</i>) Hmm, maybe you could re-conquer (<i>Cut to Zuko's unscarred side who looks on speechlessly</i>) Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King.

Yes, (<i>sits up</i>) why would (<i>chews the flower</i>) I be expecting any one different? (<i>He swallows the flower with a pained expression and coughs out some petals</i>) So what's on your mind?<br><b>Zuko</b>: Your sister, she hates me and I don't know why! But I do care what she thinks of me.<br><b>Sokka</b>: Nah, she doesn't hate you. Katara doesn't hate anyone. (<i>moves his hand across in an arc</i>) Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation. (<i>his  eyes widen as he realizes what he just said</i>) No, I mean, uh, not people who are good but used to be bad. (<i>makes pacifying gestures with his hands</i>) I mean, bad people. Fire Nation people who are so bad, who have never been good (<i>places his arms in a X shape</i>) and probably won't be ever! (<i>opens it to the side</i>)<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>interrupts</i>) Stop.

Why would you want to know that?<br><b>Zuko</b>: Katara mentioned it before when we were imprisoned together in Ba Sing Se and again just now when she was yelling at me.

(<i>Cut to a line of Fire Nation soldiers</i>) A Fire Nation raid. <br><br><i>(The soldiers yell a battle cry. Cut back to the Water Tribe warriors who ready themselves.

(<i>Cut back to Sokka who throws his boomerang. Fade back to present day Sokka.</i>) I was so relieved when it was over but, that's because I didn't know yet what have<br>happened.

Is it your turn to take a little fieldtrip with Zuko?<br><b>Katara</b>: Yes, it is.<br><b>Aang</b>: (<i>Cut to Aang who is surprised</i>) Oh. What's going on?<br><b>Katara</b>: We're going to find the man who took my Mother from me. <br><br>(<i>Cut to a surprised Sokka as he lays the necklace aside and stands up.</i>)<br><br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>off screen</i>) Sokka told me the story of what happened.

(<i>She begins to walk away</i>)<br><b>Aang</b>: (<i>Cut to a close up of Katara as Aang and Sokka look on behind her</i>) Wait, stop, I do understand. You're feeling unbelievable pain and rage. How do you think I felt about the sandbenders when they stole Appa? How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation when I found out what happened to my people?<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>off screen</i>) She needs this, (<i>everyone turn their eyes towards him</i>) Aang. This is about getting closure and justice. <br><b>Aang</b>: I don't think so. I think it's about getting revenge. <br><b>Katara</b>: (<i>off screen</i>) Fine! (<i>Cut to an angry and frustrated Katara</i>) Maybe it is. Maybe that's what I need. Maybe that's what he deserves. <br><b>Aang</b>: Katara, you sound like Jet. <br><b>Katara</b>: (<i>defensively</i>) It's not the same. Jet attacked the innocent. This man, he's a monster. <br><b>Sokka</b>: Katara, she was my Mother too. But I think Aang might be right. <br><b>Katara</b>: Then you didn't love her the way I did.<br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>speechless</i>) Katara...<br><b>Aang</b>: The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed ratviper. While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself. <br><b>Zuko</b>: That's cute. But this isn't air temple pre-school. It's the real World. <br><b>Katara</b>: (<i>Camera zooms out to place Katara on screen</i>) Now that I know he's out there, now that I know we could find him, I feel like I have no choice.<br><b>Aang</b>: Katara, you do have a choice. Forgiveness. <br><b>Zuko</b>: That's the same as doing nothing. <br><b>Aang</b>: (<i>shakes head</i>) No it's not. It's easy to do nothing. (<i>Camera slowly zooms in</i>) But it's hard to forgive. <br><b>Katara</b>: (<i>Cut to Katara who looks on darkly</i>) It's not just hard, it's impossible. <br><br>(<i>She turns and walks away.

Zuko is also wearing the same outfit as Katara and is packing his bag.</i>) Don't try to stop us. <br><b>Aang</b>: I wasn't planning to. This is a journey you need to take. You need to face this man. (<i>Katara nods and she climbs on Appa's horn to his head</i>) But when you do, please don't choose revenge. (<i>Zuko throws his bag into the saddle</i>) Let your anger out and then let it go. Forgive him. <br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut to Zuko who appears to be tired of his preaching</i>) Okay, we'll be sure to do that guru-goody-goody.

(<i>Appa flies into screen just above the water and it airbends with its tail to propel it forward. It displaces some water below</i>.) We need to be stealthy (<i>Cut to the communication tower as camera pans down to show the whole building structure and a bunch of rocks below</i>) and make sure no one spots us. Otherwise, (<i>Appa flies into screen and lands</i>) they'll warn The Southern Raiders. Long before we reach them. <br><br>(<i>Cut to the rocks as Katara and Zuko run out from behind them.
