Cut to an overhead view of the courtyard as 2 figures are seen firebending towards a derelict fountain and taking a step back. Cut to an area at Aang's side, looking at him and Zuko. In sync, they take a step forward and throw their arms down, firebending at the same time. They stretch out their right leg in front of them, firebending again. They proceed to stretch it behind them and they push out their left arm out in a "Superman" pose as they firebend with that arm. They put their legs down and exhale audibly, putting their arms in a cooling down position and bowing to each other. Katara and Toph are seen spectating at the side in their Fire Nation disguises. Zuko cracks his fingers and stretches both arms above his head and walks off screen. Aang massages his shoulder</i>.)<br><br><b>Katara</b>: (<i>Cut to a close up of the 2 girls. Toph is napping.</i>) Doesn't it seem kinda weird that we're hiding (<i>looks around the courtyard</i>) from the Fire Lord in his own house? <br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut to Zuko sitting at the fountain, wiping his hair with a yellow towel</i>) I told you, my Father hasn't come here since our family was actually happy. And that was a long time ago. This is the last place anyone would think to look for us. <br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>Cut to an area behind the girls looking at the boys as Sokka and Suki walk into screen</i>) You guys are not going to believe this. There's a play about us. <br><b>Suki</b>: (<i>Cut to a close up of the couple. Suki has donned a Fire Nation disguise similar to Azula's evening outfit in The Beach</i>) We were just in town and we found this poster. <br><br>(<i>Sokka unveils the poster at the camera. It's a parody of the Season 1 box set DVD cover and Zuko's scar is on the wrong side</i>.)<br><br><b>Katara</b>: (<i>Cut to an area behind Sokka as he shows the poster to his sister</i>) What? (<i>He shows the poster to Aang)</i> How is that possible?<br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>He flips the poster back</i>) Listen to this. (<i>Cut to a frontal shot of Sokka with the back of the poster facing the camera</i>) "The Boy in the Iceberg is a new production from acclaimed playwright Pu On Tim who scoured (<i>Cut to the poster as camera pans up on the main characters with heavily exaggerated features. Sokka is pictured as a muscled man in his Season 2 outfit</i>) the globe gathering information on the Avatar from the icy South Pole to the heart of Ba Sing Se. (<i>Cut to an overhead shot of the scene</i>) His sources including singing nomads, pirates, prisoners of war and a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage." <br><b>Suki</b>: (<i>leans in to read the last line)</i> "Brought to you by the critically acclaimed Ember Island Players." <br><br>(<i>Sokka lets go of the scroll's bottom and it curls back.</i>)<br><br><b>Zuko</b>: Ugh. (<i>Cut to a close up of Zuko with a disgusted look on his face</i>) My Mother used to take us to see them. They butchered "Love Amongst The Dragons" every year. <br><b>Katara</b>: (<i>Cut to a close up side shot of Katara as she turns back to her brother)</i> Sokka, do you really think it's a good idea for us to attend a play about ourselves? <br><b>Sokka</b>: Come on, a day at the theatre? (<i >Unrolls the scroll towards his sister</i>) This is the kind of wacky time wasting nonsense I've been missing. <br><br>(<i>He grins widely. Fade to a side view shot of the theatre at night. Cut to the curtains on the stage. Camera zooms out to show the Gaang walking into a private viewing box on the second floor facing the stage. Toph and Katara take their seats. Zuko walks in the opposite direction wearing a hooded cloak and sits beside Katara as Aang confidently tries to sit next to her. He is wearing a hat similar to Dock's in The Painted Lady to cover his bald, tattooed head. Aang stands up rubs his neck.</i>)<br><br><b>Aang</b>: Hey, uh... I wanted to sit (<i>points at Zuko's spot</i>) there. (<i>he clenches his hands together</i>)<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>lowers his hood</i>) Just sit next to me, what's the big deal? <br><b>Aang</b>: I was (<i>Katara looks at the commotion and looks back to the stage</i>) just... I wanted to... (<i>sits next to Zuko</i>) Okay.<br><b>Toph</b>: (<i>Cut to an undershot of the viewing box as Sokka and Suki sit in the row behind the 4 of them</i>) Why are we sitting in the nose bleed section? My feet (<i>the lights in the theatre dim down</i>) can't see a thing from up here.<br><b>Katara</b>: Don't worry, I'll tell your feet what's happening.<br><br>(<i>Cut to the stage as the curtain is drawn up to reveal a prop of a canoe surrounded by moving set decorations of water. The backdrop is a crude painting of icebergs. The Katara and Sokka actors are rowing the canoe with their oars. Cut to Katara who is excited. A hand touches her shoulder and she looks up, smiling at her brother and the camera zooms out as Sokka points to her and back to himself rapidly. He makes sounds of astonishment. Cut to Katara's actress who is much more developed and bigger sized than the real Katara and her clothes are a little revealing. She has too much blusher on her cheeks.</i>) <br><br><b>Actress Katara</b>: (<i>sighs</i>) Sokka, my only brother. We constantly roam these icy South Pole seas and yet never do we find anything fulfilling. <br><b>Actor Sokka</b>: (<i>Camera pans to the right to show Sokka's actor who is buck-toothed and thinner than the actual Sokka. His "wolf-tail" is an overly large ponytail bun</i>.) All I want is a full feeling in my stomach, I'm starving! <br><br>(<i>Cut to the audience near the stage as they laugh heartily.

Cut to an area in the audience in front of the stage, looking at the boat.)</i><br><br><b>Actress Katara</b>: Is food the only thing on your mind? <br><b>Actor Sokka</b>: Well, I'm trying to get it out of my mind and (<i>Cut to a close up of actor Sokka as he points to his mouth</i>) into my mouth. I'm starving. <br><br><i>(The audience laughs once again. Cut back to the Gaang's viewing box as Sokka complains to his sister</i>.)<br><br><b>Sokka</b>: This is pathetic. My (<i>points his thumb to himself</i>) jokes are way funnier than this. (<i>throws out his arm towards the stage</i>)<br><b>Toph</b>: (<i>Toph laughs and the siblings look at her</i>) I think he's got you pegged.<br><br>(<i>Cut back to the stage as actress Katara stands up while actor Sokka continues paddling</i>.)<br><br><b>Actress Katara</b>: Everyday, the World awaits a beacon to guide us, yet none appears. Still, we cannot give up hope. (<i>she places her hand to her chest in a melodramatic way</i>) For hope (<i>she sniffles</i>) is all we have (<i>her voice begins to be choked with "tears")</i> and we must never relinquish it. Even... (<i>sniffling</i>) even to our dying breath. <br><br>(<i>She pretends to cry.</i>)<br><br><b>Katara</b>: (<i>Cut back to the Gaang's viewing box as Katara is unamused</i>) Well, (<i>Suki and Sokka laugh</i>) that's just silly. I don't sound like that. <br><b>Toph</b>: (<i>giggles and clutches her stomach</i>) Oh man, this writer's a genius. <br><br>(<i>Cut back to actress Katara who is still crying as white-blue light illuminates behind her.

A cut out of Aang sways from side to side on a stick inside the iceberg.)</i> It appears to be someone frozen in ice. Perhaps for a hundred years. <br><b>Actor Sokka</b>: (<i>Cut to a close up of the cut out.)</i> But who?

Zuko looks bored.)</i><br><br><b>Actress Katara</b>: (<i>Cut to actress Katara who is already on top of the iceberg prop. Actor Sokka is still climbing up</i>) Waterbend, hai-ya! <br><br>(<i>She performs a chopping motion and the Aang cut out is pulled down. Cracks appear on the iceberg and it opens with the interior smoking. The actors look at each other in mock surprise. Cut to a close up of the smoke as a lady dressed as Aang jumps out, winks and poses. Like actress Katara, her make up is heavy. Cut to Aang who is repulsed. Cut back to a close up of the iceberg.)</i> <br><br><b>Actress Katara</b>: Who are you, frozen boy?<br><b>Actress >Aang</b>: (<i>giggles and balances tip toed on one leg</i>) I'm the Avatar, silly. Here to spread (<i>pirouettes on her balancing leg</i>) joy and fun. <br><b>Aang</b>: (<i>in disbelief</i>) Wait, is that a woman playing me? <br><br>(<i>Cut back to the iceberg as a shaggy, white Chinese lion get-up from traditional Chinese lion dances pops out from the remnants of the iceberg and moves from side to side. It jumps off the iceberg. Cut to a full view of the stage as the Appa lion circles round the iceberg and makes a gruff animal noise. The 3 dancers controlling the lion costume have worn shaggy pants to show that Appa has 6 legs</i>.)<br><br><b>Actress Katara</b>: (<i>gasp</i>) An airbender. My heart is so full of hope that it's (<i>drops to her knees</i>) making me (<i>grabs actress Aang's leg and cries</i>) tearbend.<br><br>(<i>Cut to a close up of actress Katara as she makes sobbing noises. Cut back to a full view of the 3 actors on the iceberg prop.</i>)<br><br><b>Actor Sokka</b>: My stomach is so empty that it's making me tearbend. (<i>He drops to his knees and grabs actress Aang's other leg and sobs</i>) I need meat.

(<i>Cut back to Aang who is visibly unamused and is slumped against the railing</i>) Is that a platter of meaty dumplings? <br><b>Actor Sokka</b>: (<i>off screen</i>) Ooo. (<i>Cut back to the 3 actors as actor Sokka looks around</i>) Where? Where? <br><b>Actress</b> <b>Aang</b>: (<i>giggles uncontrollably</i>) Did I mention (<i>crosses her legs</i>) that I'm an incurable prankster? <br><br>(<i>Cut back to the Gaang's viewing box as the audience laughs off screen.</i>)<br><br><b>Aang</b>: (<i>irritated</i>) I don't do that. That's not what I'm like! And... I'm not a woman!<br><b>Toph</b>: (<i>laughs out loud as the rest turn to look at her</i>) Oh, they nailed you, Twinkle Toes. <br><br>(<i>Aang slumps onto the railing again. Cut back to the stage as Zuko's ship enters with actor Zuko poised near the front of the ship, looking through a telescope.</i>)<br><br><b>Actor Uncle</b>: (<i>Cut to actor Uncle who is portrayed a little more accurately</i>) Prince Zuko, you must try this cake. <br><br>(<i>He brings up a whole cake on a plate but one slice missing.</i>)<br><br><b>Actor Zuko</b>: (<i>Camera pans to the right to show actor Zuko in Zuko's Fire Nation armor with a long ponytail.

He</i> <i>lowers the telescope and faces the audience</i>) I must capture the Avatar to regain my honor!<br><b>Actor Uncle</b>: (<i>Cut to a full view of the ship prop</i>) Well, while you do that, maybe I'll capture another slice. <br><br>(<i>He proceeds to bring the plate of cake to his mouth and makes loud, masticating noises</i>)<br><br><b>Actor Zuko</b>: You sicken me. (<i>He looks through the telescope again</i>)<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut back to Zuko with Katara looking very amused</i>) They make me<br>totally stiff and humorless. <br><b>Katara</b>: Actually, I think that actor's pretty spot on.<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>looks to Katara and stretches both arms out</i>) How could you say that?<br><b>Actor Uncle</b>: (<i>Cut back to actor Zuko still looking through the telescope as actor Uncle appears behind him</i>) Let's forget about the Avatar and get massages.<br><b>Actor Zuko</b>: (<i>turns back to actor Uncle, outraged</i>) How could you say that?!<br><br>(<i>Cut back to Katara wearing a satisfied grin on her face and she looks to an expressionless Zuko as he slouches in his seat</i>.<br><br><i>Cut to the backdrop of the Southern Air Temple as the camera pans down to actress Aang looking around.

Cut the Water Tribe actors as they look at each other, puzzled</i>.) I found something. (<i>Cut to actress Aang who steps away from the bush with a large puppet of Momo sitting on her shoulder</i>) It's a flying rabbit monkey.
