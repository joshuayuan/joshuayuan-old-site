Cut to Aang's boot shifting to the side into a stance. Camera zooms out to reveal a full body shot of Aang practicing in front of the beach house with the rest of the Gaang resting on steps in the background. Aang proceeds to firebend arcs with his arms, right leg followed by his left leg. He walks towards the camera as he does so. Then he firebends a flurry of small shot, circles rapidly with his arms. Cut to Zuko who is looking sternly at Aang's training with his arms crossed.)</i><br><br><b>Zuko</b>: More ferocious! <br><br>(<i>Aang's fist firebends into the camera's view and his head comes into view as he walks forward. He has an intense look of concentration on his face.</i>)<br><br><b>Zuko</b>: Imagine striking through your opponent's heart. <br><br>(<i>Aang firebends another big shot of fire towards the camera and turns towards Zuko with his arms in a frustrated gesture.</i>)<br><br><b>Aang</b>: Ugh! I'm trying.<br><b>Zuko</b>: Now let me hear you roar like a tiger-dillo! <br><br>(<i>Aang turns back to the camera instantly, stretches his arms and roars rather softly with weak streams of fire coming out from his palm and mouth. Aang grins sheepishly at his weak attempt.</i>)<br><br><b>Zuko</b>: That sounded pathetic! (<i>Cut back to Zuko lashing out</i>) I said roar!<br><br>(<i>Cut to Aang's back view. Camera quickly cuts to Aang's front view. He turns around, roars ferociously and firebends rather strongly out of both hands and his mouth. The camera changes to an overhead shot to show the intensity of the flames. Momo can be seen scurrying towards Zuko. Cut to Zuko's legs as Momo seeks refuge behind them</i>. <br><br><i>Camera moves up to show Zuko nodding his head in approval. Cut to Katara holding two watermelons with straws in them.</i>)<br><br><b>Katara</b>: Who wants a nice, cool glass of watermelon juice? <br><br>(<i>Cut back to Aang who comically has an exclamation mark over his head. His eyes widen with greed.</i>)<br><br><b>Aang</b>: Ooo, ooo, (<i>turns around</i>) me, me, me! (<i>he begins to run towards the house</i>)<br><b>Zuko</b>: Hey, (<i>Zuko's hand comes into screen and holds Aang back by his robes</i>) your lesson's not over yet! (<i>Aang tries to break free of his grip and his tongue comically sticks out to show that he is thirsty.</i>) Get back here. <br><br>(<i>Aang gets pulled up and the camera zooms out to show Zuko pulling him up effortlessly with Aang looking rather disappointed.</i>)<br><br><b>Suki: </b>(<i>off screen</i>) Come on, Zuko. (<i>Cut to Suki and Sokka lounging on the steps. Sokka drinks his watermelon juice and looks on.</i>) Just take a break. What's the big deal?<br><b>Zuko</b>: Fine. <br><br>(<i>He releases Aang and Aang dashes off, leaving a trail of dust behind.)</i><br><br><b>Zuko</b>: If you want to lounge around (<i>Cut to the top of the steps to show Aang running towards Katara and accepting the watermelon with glee and proceeds to slurp the juice noisily and greedily</i>) like a bunch of snail-sloths all day, then go ahead! (<i>Zuko turns and walks away)</i><br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>off screen</i>) Maybe Zuko's right. (<i>Cut back to Sokka</i>.) Sitting around the house has made us pretty lazy. But I know (<i>lays his watermelon aside and stands up slowly</i>) just the thing to change that. Beach party! <br><br>(<i>He removes his outer coat, revealing a pair of brown undershorts underneath and dives excitedly out of the camera's view. Camera changes scene to the ocean to show that he entered the water with a splash. Sokka surfaces with seaweed on his head and he blows water from his mouth. He grins goofily.</i><br><br><i>Cut to Katara jumping off the shore into the water as she waterbends a surfboard made of ice. She proceeds to surf as the water displaced by her movements splashes against the camera. Cut to the underside of the ice surfboard as Katara jumps off a wave of water and her image is silhouetted against the Sun. She lands back into the water with ease and continues surfing. Cut to Suki laying on a beach mat in her red beach outfit. She smiles as Sokka walks into screen carrying seaweed in his arms. She looks puzzled as Sokka grabs empty pails and exits the screen before re-entering a spilt second later with the buckets full of water and a huge smile plastered on his face.</i><br><br><i>Cut to Aang who is holding a big piece of wood in his hand. Camera zooms out to show him placing the piece of wood as a horn into his sand sculpture of Appa.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: (<i>raises both arms</i>) Check out my Appa sand sculpture. (<i>Camera zooms and shows the real Appa growling at the sight. Toph walks into screen.)</i><br><b>Toph</b>: Not bad, baldy. But I've been working on my sandbending (<i>stretches and cracks her fingers</i>) You're gonna love this.<br><br>(<i>Cut to the area in front of Toph. She moves her hands and sends clouds of sand dust everywhere. The dust clears to reveal a miniature replica of Ba Sing Se in the sand. Cut to the top view to show the huge Earth King's palace in the middle with tiny houses surrounding it. Aang walks towards it and kneels down, scrutinising the details.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: Whoa. (<i>he looks at the sand replica of Earth King Kuei and his bear, Bosco</i>) Wow, you even made a little Earth King and Bosco.<br><br>(<i>Cut to Sokka who is frantically carving at his sculpture, sending specks of sand flying everywhere. Toph & Aang walk into screen behind him.</i>)<br><br><b>Toph</b>: Try and top that, Sokka.<br><b>Sokka</b>: Ta-da! <br><br>(<i>He reveals his sand sculpture with seaweed for hair, stones for eyes, a red starfish for a nose, and some stones and seashells as a smile.</i>)<br><br><b>Aang</b>: Is that a blubbering, blob monster? <br><b>Sokka</b>: No, (<i>stomps the ground defensively</i>) it's Suki. (<i>Cut to Aang with an animated look of shock and surprise on his face as both he and Toph burst into a fit of laughter.)</i><br><b>Toph</b>: Suki, we'll all understand if you break up with him over this.<br><b>Suki:</b> I think it's sweet. (<i>Sokka runs and slides into screen on his knees as he grabs Suki by her shoulders and kisses her on the cheek.</i>)<br><b>Aang</b>: But it doesn't even look like... <br><br>(<i>A burst of fire hits the sand sculpture, sending waves of send everywhere. Aang yells in surprise and shields himself from the impact. The dust clears and Aang looks up at the cliff. Cut to Zuko running and jumping off the cliff, firebending at Aang at the same time. Aang narrowly misses the flames and jumps across Toph's sand sculpture. Cut to the bottom of the sculpture as Aang flies across it. A ball of fire hits one of the sand houses, breaking it into a wave of sand instantly. Aang lands on the other side near his sand sculpture as he turns around and looks frightened. He then jumps over his sand sculpture.</i><br><br><i>Cut to the inside of Toph's sand sculpture as Zuko lands in front of it. He runs on the sculpture towards Aang. Aang peeks out from behind Appa's sand head.</i>)<br><br><b>Aang</b>: What are you doing?!<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut to Zuko's boot stopping in the sand. Cut to Zuko's face.)</i> Teaching you a lesson! <br><br>(<i>He firebends towards the Appa sculpture. Aang looks away before the camera zooms out to show him jumping away from the impact. The stream of fire "cuts" the Appa sculpture in half, destroying it into a pile of sand.</i><br><br><i>Cut to Zuko's sidev iew as Aang lands a distance away from him. Zuko turns and firebends towards Aang but he misses as Aang jumps onto the cliff. Zuko firebends towards the cliff repeatedly as Aang struggles to run across the uneven surface. Zuko's last blast shatters the top part of the cliff into rubble. Cut to an overhead shot of Zuko as he runs towards the cliff and proceeds to scale it.</i><br><br><i>Cut to Katara who surfs back to shore</i>.)<br><br><b>Katara</b>: What happened?<br><b>Sokka</b>: Zuko's gone crazy! I made a sand sculpture of Suki (<i>tries to pick up the fallen sand to mould the sculpture back into shape</i>) and he destroyed it! Oh, and he's attacking Aang. <br><br>(<i>Suki grabs Sokka and they run back to help Aang.</i><br><br><i>Cut back to Aang with Zuko hot on his heel. Zuko firebends at him but Aang jumps out of the way in time. The fire clears and Zuko is still chasing after Aang angrily. Cut to the side of a huge rock as Aang runs to the top of it and jumps off before Zuko sends strong blasts of fire at the rock, disintegrating it into pieces. Aang grabs onto the top of a trunk of a nearby tree as Zuko jumps off the rock and somersaults to the bottom. </i><br><br><i>Cut to Zuko landing on the sand with a roll and firebending at the top of the tree. Aang jumps away. Camera zooms out to show that the tree has caught fire and Aang lands somewhere on the beach house's roof, out of view. Cut to Zuko who jumps onto the beach house's railings as he scales and flips his way to the roof. Cut to rooftop as Zuko's head appears into screen and he pushes himself with his arm and lands in a stance. Camera zooms out to show Aang waiting for him in a similar stance.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: Get a grip before I blast you off this roof!<br><b>Zuko</b>: Go ahead and do it! <br><br>(<i>He then firebends with his fists and feet one after another. Cut to Aang sliding down the roof as jets of fire sets the path he was on alight. Aang reaches the end of the roof and he grabs onto the edge as he swings himself into a nearby room through the window. He slides across the floor on his knees to hide behind a drawer. A huge blast of fire through the roof sends some debris into the room and Zuko lands. He gets into a stance and looks around the room warily. Aang then kicks the drawer towards Zuko. He blocks it by disintegrating the drawer into pieces with a firebending punch.</i><br><br><i>Cut to the end of the corridor as Aang runs out from the room followed shortly by Zuko. Zuko firebends huge whips and arcs of flame around himself. Cut to Zuko's back view as he sends the tunnel of fire towards Aang. Cut to Aang running away desperately and time slows down as Aang looks back to find himself being slowly engulfed by the fire. Time resumes back to normal as he airbends the fire away, creating a safe space for him to land on without get burnt. Cut to Aang's face as the fire reflects off his eyes.) </i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: (<i>furiously</i>) Enough!<br><br>(<i>He airbends a huge tunnel of air towards Zuko, extinguishing the flames at the same time. Cut to Zuko yelling in surprise as he gets pushed back by the strong air pressure. Cut to the outside of the house as its side gets ripped open by the visible tunnel of wind, throwing out some wooden debris along with Zuko. The sound effects suggests that Zuko is sliding down some tree branches. Cut to the grass as Zuko lands on it and attempts to stand up, grabbing his head and moaning slightly. The others come into screen behind Zuko.</i>)<br><br><b>Katara</b>: What's wrong with you?! (<i>Aang jumps off the balcony and lands near the group</i>.) You could have hurt Aang.<br><b>Zuko</b>: What's wrong with me? What's wrong with all of you! (<i>Cut to Zuko's front view as he stands up and throws his arm to the side in anger)</i> How can you sit around having beach parties when Sozin's Comet (<i>Camera slowly pans through the rest of the group who have guilty looks on their faces</i>) is only 3 days away! <br><br>(<i>Cut to a top view of the group.</i>)<br><br><b>Zuko</b>: Why are you all looking at me like I'm crazy? <br><b>Aang</b>: About Sozin's Comet... (<i>takes a step forward</i>) I was actually going to wait to fight the Fire Lord until after it came.<br><b>Zuko</b>: After? <br><b>Aang</b>: I'm not ready. (<i>looks unconfident and unsure</i>) I need more time to master firebending.<br><b>Toph</b>: And frankly, your earthbending could still use some work too. (<i>Aang looks disappointed</i>)<br><b>Zuko</b>: So... You all knew Aang was going to wait? <br><b>Sokka</b>: Honestly, if Aang tries to fight the Fire Lord right now, he's gonna lose. No offence.<br><b>Katara</b>: The whole point of fighting the Fire Lord before the comet was to stop the Fire Nation from winning the war. But they pretty much won the war when they took Ba Sing Se. Things can't get any worse. (<i>drops her head in worry</i>)<br><b>Zuko</b>: You're wrong. (<i>turns head towards camera</i>) It's about to get worse than you can even imagine.<br><br>(<i>Scene fades to the corridor leading to the Fire Lord's war room.)</i><br><br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>voiceover</i>) The day before the eclipse, my Father asked me to attend an important war meeting. (<i>Zuko's servants help him wear and tighten his armor shoulder pads as he walks towards the room</i>) It was what I dreamed about (<i>the servants bow in respect</i>) and wanted (<i>Cut to Zuko standing in front of the war room's curtain entrance</i>) for so many years. My Father (<i>Camera slowly zooms in on Zuko's back and he raises both hands</i>) had finally accepted me back. (<i>Cut to the opposite side of the curtain as Zuko thrusts the curtain apart, revealing his presence. He walks forward. Cut to the top of Fire Lord Ozai's throne to show the whole room. There is a map of the Earth Kingdom spread out on a table with generals seated around the length of the table.</i>) <br><br><b>Fire Lord Ozai</b>: Welcome, Prince Zuko. We waited for you. <br><br>(<i>Cut to the generals glancing at Zuko. Cut to full view of the throne. Azula is already seated on Ozai's left. Ozai gestures to his son to take his seat and Zuko bows before sitting down. Cut to a close up sideview of Ozai watching his son.</i>)<br><br><b>Fire Lord Ozai</b>: General Shinu, your report. <br><b>General Shinu</b>: (<i>Cut to Shinu who bows his head in acknowledgement</i>) Thank you, sir. (<i>He stands up</i>) Ba Sing Se is still under our control. (<i>Cut to an area behind Ozai and shows Shinu slowly pacing his way to the end of the table</i>) However, earthbender rebellions have prevented us from achieving total victory in the Earth Kingdom.<br><b>Fire Lord Ozai</b>: (<i>Cut to Ozai who frowns at the news</i>) What is your recommendation?<br><b>General Shinu</b>: Our army is spread too thin but once the eclipse is over and the invasion defeated, we should transfer more domestic forces into the Earth Kingdom. <br> <br>(<i>Cut back to a close up sideview shot of Ozai. Zuko is slouching and appears uninterested.)</i><br><br><b>Fire Lord Ozai</b>: Hmm... (<i>turns his head to his son</i>) Prince Zuko, (<i>Zuko looks at his father</i>) you've been among the Earth Kingdom commoners. Do you think that adding more troops will stop these rebellions?<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut to the front view of Zuko as he drops his head and thinks</i>) The people of the Earth Kingdom are proud and strong. They can endure anything as long as they have hope. <br><b>Fire Lord Ozai</b>: Yes, you're right. (<i>Cut to a close up shot of his face as he gives an evil, lethal look</i>) We need to destroy their hope.<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut to a side view of Father and son</i>) Well, that's not exactly what I...<br><b>Azula</b>: (<i>interrupts</i>) I think you should take their precious hope (<i>fingers her fringe and tosses it aside without a care</i>) and the rest of their land, (<i>looks at the table fiercely</i>) and burn it all to the ground. <br><br><i>(The princess crosses her arms and smiles at her own brilliant suggestion.)</i><br><br><b>Fire Lord Ozai</b>: Yes... (<i>Smiles evilly</i>) Yes, you're right, Azula.(<i>Cut to Azula who smiles at her Father's acknowledgement of her plan. Ozai gets up and walks towards the table.</i>) Sozin's Comet is almost upon us (<i>Cut to a full view of the table and throne and Ozai stops near the edge of the table</i>) and on that day it will endow us with the strength and power of a hundred Suns. No bender will stand a chance against us. <br><b>General Shinu</b>: (<i>Cut to an area behind Ozai's back as his generals and Shinu look on</i>) What are you suggesting, sir? <br><b>Fire Lord Ozai</b>: When the comet last came, my grandfather, Fire Lord Sozin, used it to wipe out the Air Nomads. Now, I will use its power to end the Earth Kingdom. (<i>Cut to Zuko and the camera slowly zooms in on him. He is shocked as his Father's cruel revelation.</i>) Permanently. (<i>Cut to the front view of Ozai as he grins from ear to ear and walks across the table</i>) From our airships, (<i>Cut to the Earth Kingdom area of the map and the camera slowly zooms out as Ozai's shadow covers the East side of the continent</i>) we will rain fire over their lands. A fire that will destroy <i>everything</i>. (<i>Ozai walks across from one side of the map to middle of it</i>) And out of the ashes, (<i>he opens his arms to the side</i>) a new World will be born. A World in which <i>all</i> the lands are Fire Nation and <i>I</i> am (<i>Cut back to the front view of Ozai as he raises his arms high</i>) the supreme ruler of everything! (<i>the generals burst into applause.</i>)<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut to the sideview of Zuko's scarred eye as he looks down</i>) I wanted to speak out against this horrifying plan. (<i>Cut to an area behind Zuko's head as it slowly zooms in on the back of his head. The generals are still applauding and Ozai basks in the excitement.</i>) But I'm ashamed to say I didn't. (<i>Cut back to present day Zuko</i>) My whole life I struggled to gain my Father's love and acceptance. (<i>Cut to show the whole Gaang looking at Zuko who is sitting on a rock</i>) But once I had it, I realized I lost myself getting there. (<i>Katara raises her hand to her forehead in despair</i>) I forgotten who I was. <br><br>(<i>Katara drops down to the ground on her knees. Sokka grabs Suki by the shoulder in an assuring gesture.</i>)<br><br><b>Katara</b>: I can't believe this. (<i>shakes her head</i>)<br><b>Sokka</b>: I always knew that the Fire Lord was a bad guy but his plan is just pure evil. (<i>Suki shakes her head</i>)<br><b>Aang</b>: What am I going to do? <br><b>Zuko</b>: I know you're scared. (<i>he stands up and walks towards Aang</i>) And I know that you're not ready to save the World. But if you don't defeat the<br>Fire Lord before the comet comes, (<i>Cut to Zuko who is looking very serious</i>) there won't be a World to save anymore. <br><br>(<i>Camera slowly zooms in on Aang who looks stunned and blur. Cut to commercial break.</i>)<br><br><br><br><b><u>Act II</u></b><br><br>(<i>Scene returns with Aang facing the group.</i>)<br><br><b>Aang</b>: Why (<i>points to self</i>) didn't you tell me (<i>turns around and walks off screen</i>) about your Dad's crazy plan sooner?<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>takes a step forward</i>) I didn't think I had to. I assumed that you were still going to fight him before the comet. No one told me you decided to wait! <br><b>Aang</b>: This is bad. (<i>places both hands on head in despair</i>) This is really, (<i>shakes his head and drops to his knees</i>) really bad. (<i>Cut to a close up of Aang whose face is full of worry and despair</i>)<br><b>Katara</b>: (<i>off screen</i>) Aang, you (<i>Cut to a side shot where Katara is standing behind Aang. He looks up at her</i>) don't have to do this alone. (<i>Toph and Zuko walk into screen</i>)<br><b>Toph</b>: Yeah. (<i>Suki and Sokka join in)</i> If we all fight the Fire Lord together, we got a shot at taking him down. <br><b>Sokka</b>: Alright! (<i>raises arm in enthusiasm</i>) Team Avatar is back! (<i>points confidently</i>) Air. (<i>Cut to Aang</i>) Water. (<i>Cut to Katara</i>) Earth. (<i>Cut to Toph</i>) Fire. (<i>Cut to Zuko</i>) Fan (<i>picks up a palm leaf in a shape of a fan from the ground into Suki's hands</i>) and sword! (<i>He thrusts a blade of leaf into the air. The background music makes a comical sound and the tip of the leaf falls</i>)<br><b>Aang</b>: Fighting the Fire Lord is going to be the hardest thing we've ever done together. But I wouldn't want to do it any other way. (<i>The group laughs and they engage in a group hug but Zuko remains standing where he is</i>)<br><b>Toph</b>: Yeah.<br><b>Sokka</b>: Alright.<br><b>Katara</b>: Get over here, Zuko. Being part of the group also means being part of group hugs. <br><br>(<i>Zuko looks to the side with a "Do I have to this " look on his face and fits into the opening Suki & Toph created. Appa growls off screen, the Gaang looks up and they get tackled to the ground by the giant sky bison. Momo chatters away on Appa's head.</i><br><br><i>Cut to an overhead view of the courtyard in the beach house.</i>)<i></i><br><br><b>Zuko</b>: There's one technique you need (<i>Cut to a close up shot of Zuko standing in front of Aang. Katara and Momo sit at the side, spectating</i>) to know before facing my Father. How to redirect lightning. (<i>Aang grins with anticipation</i>) If you let the energy in your own body flow, (<i>He stretches his left arm out and the fingers on his right hand touch the fingers on his left hand and swiftly traces a path down his arm, shoulder, stomach and back out the other side</i>) the lightning will follow it. (<i>His left hand touches his right, they are parallel to each other</i>) You turn your opponent's energy against them. <br><br>(<i>He repeats the motion to the left side of his body.</i>)<br><br><b>Aang</b>: That's like waterbending.<br><b>Zuko</b>: Exactly. My Uncle (<i>Aang begins to mimic Zuko's movements</i>) invented this technique himself by studying waterbenders. <br><b>Aang</b>: So... Have you ever redirected lightning before?<br><b>Zuko</b>: Once. Against my Father. <br><b>Aang</b>: What did it feel like? (<i>Zuko stops whatever he is doing and does a cool down motion with his hands</i>)<br><b>Zuko</b>: Exhilarating. (<i>Cut to a flashback of Ozai throwing lightning at Zuko and he re-directing it back during their confrontation in "The Eclipse"</i>) But terrifying. (<i>Cut back to Aang who has raised both arms eagerly to his chest but his face falls when Zuko says those two words</i>) You feel so powerful (<i>Aang's hands drops back to the side. He slouches with disappointment</i>) holding that much energy in your body. But you know that you make the wrong move, it's over.<br><b>Aang</b>: Heh. (<i>laughs nervously</i>) Well, not over over, right I mean there's always Katara and a little spirit water (<i>moves his hand in a watery movement</i>) action... Am I right? (<i>turns to Katara</i>)<br><b>Katara</b>: (<i>matter-of-factly</i>) Actually I used it all up after Azula shot you.<br><b>Aang</b>: Oh.<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>stares at Aang seriously</i>) You'll have to take the Fire Lord's life. Before he takes yours.<br><b>Aang</b>: Yeah... I'll just do that. <br><br>(<i>Cut to an overhead view of the courtyard as Zuko walks away. Fade to an area full of rocks at dusk.</i>)<br><br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>off screen</i>) Gather round Team Avatar. (<i>Cut to a watermelon with some face carvings resembling a jack-o-lantern being dropped onto a wooden structure with a red cloth draped over it. Camera zooms out to reveal Sokka standing in front of the Melon Lord and the rest of the group walking towards him and proceeding to sit in a circle</i>) In order to take out the Fire Lord, or in this case, the "Melon Lord", our timing has to be perfect. (<i>He kneels down</i>) First, Suki and I will draw his fire. (<i>He takes a stick and draws a line curving to the left towards the melon symbol on the ground</i>) Then, Katara and Zuko (<i>He draws a straight line in the middle</i>) charge in with some liquidy hot offence and while the "Melon Lord" is distracted, Aang swoops in and "BAM!" (<i>He draws a line curving to the right which runs through the melon symbol</i>) He delivers the final blow. (<i>Cut to who Aang stares at the drawing with slight disgust</i>)<br><b>Toph</b>: Err... (<i>Camera shifts to the right</i>) what about me? <br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>off screen</i>) For now, you're the Melon Lord's forces.<br><b>Toph</b>: So I get to chuck flaming rocks at all of you?<br><b>Sokka</b>: Whatever makes the training feel more realistic.<br><b>Toph</b>: Sweetness. (<i>smiles</i>)<br><br>(<i>Camera fades to reveal the Melon Lord with 2 sticks at arms opened up in a V-shape.
