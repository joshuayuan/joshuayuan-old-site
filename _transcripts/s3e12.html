Seems like my dad just got out, now he's going back in.<br><br>(<i>Cut to an overhead shot of Sokka and The Duke</i>)<br><br><b>The Duke</b>: I miss Pipsqueak.<br><b>Sokka</b>: I miss not having blisters (<i>Cut to an overhead shot behind Appa</i>) on my feet.<br><br>(<i>Cut to a close up of the rocky ground as Toph's foot stomps into screen. Cut to a close up of Toph with a relieved expression on her face.</i>)<br><br><b>Toph</b>: Hey, we're here. I can feel it.<br><br>(<i>Camera pans out to show the group stopping near the edge of a cliff. The camera pans to the right to show a vast empty space filled with white mist in between the cliff they're standing on and the next</i>.)<br><br><b>Katara</b> :<i>(off screen)</i> Uh, I think your feet need their eyes checked.<br><b>Aang</b>: (<i>off screen</i>) No, (<i>Cut back to Aang with Sokka in the background</i>) she's right, (<i>Sokka looks up at Aang, stunned</i>) we are here.<br><br>(<i>Sokka looks around and brings up both his arms to show that he can't see anything.

(<i>The camera pans down slowly</i>) The chances of finding him here are very slim. (<i>Cut to a shot of Zuko's bandaged side</i>)<br><b>Zuko</b>: First, we'll check each of the air temples. (<i>takes a few steps forward, looking around</i>) Then we'll scour the world, searching even the most remote locations until we find him.<br><b>Iroh</b>: (<i>Iroh looks on, concerned</i>) Prince Zuko, it's only been a week since your banishment. (<i>Cut to a far back view shot of the 2</i>) You should take some time to heal and rest.<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>turns around and raises his voice</i>) What else would I expect to hear from the <i>laziest</i> man in the <i>Fire Nation</i>? (<i>Cut to a close up of Iroh's slightly appalled face as he looks down and sighs</i>) The only way (<i>Cut back to a frontal shot of uncle and nephew</i>) to regain my honor is to find the Avatar. So I will.<br><br>(<i>Iroh glances up at Zuko, turns, and walks away. Cut back to present day Zuko with his eyes closed.

Cut to Zuko taking cover from behind a pillar as Appa flies into screen. Zuko crouches down</i>. <br><br><i>Cut to a frontal shot of Zuko's face as he looks on from behind the pillar.

Cut to Teo and The Duke looking up in wonder.)</i><br><br><b>Teo</b>: It's so different from the Northern Air Temple. (<i>Camera pans to a flight of stairs linking to a bridge</i>) I wonder if there are any secret rooms.<br><b>Haru</b>: (<i>Haru runs into screen and waves a hand, beckoning the others to join him</i>) Let's go check it out.<br><br>(<i>Cut to The Duke and Teo as they enthusiastically make their way off screen. Aang runs after them but is stopped by Katara who blocks him with his staff</i>.)<br><br><b>Katara</b>: You guys go... (<i>Aang catches his glider and Katara lays a hand on his shoulder</i>) I think we need to talk about some things.<br><br>(<i>Cut to the top of the bridge as Haru and The Duke help Teo onto it.

Cut to a close up of a disappointed Aang</i>.)<br><br><b>Aang</b>: Why can't I go?<br><b>Katara</b>: (<i>Cut to a serious Katara</i>) We need to decide what we're gonna do now. And since you're the Avatar, maybe you should be a part of this.<br><br>(<i>Cut to a flat, slightly broken down stone bench as Aang leans his staff against it and sits down and crosses his arms grouchily</i>.)<br><br><b>Aang</b>: Fair enough. So, what's the new plan?<br><br>(<i>Cut to a wide shot of the Gaang with each of them sitting on stone benches except for Toph who is sitting on a rather tall stone column</i>)<br><br><b>Sokka</b>: Well, if you ask me, the <i>new</i> plan is the <i>old</i> plan. You just need to master all four elements, and confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes.<br><b>Aang</b>: (<i>sarcastically</i>) Oh, yeah, that's great. (<i>He picks up a pebble and tosses it into the air nonchalantly</i>) No problem, (<i>He continues fidgeting)</i> I'll just do that. (<i>He lays the pebble on the bench</i> <i>and flicks it away</i>.)<br><b>Katara</b>: Aang, no one said it's gonna be easy.<br><b>Aang</b>: (<i>continuing his little tantrum</i>) Well, it's not even gonna be possible. Where am I supposed to get a firebending teacher?<br><b>Katara</b>: (<i>deep in thought</i>) We could look for Jeong Jeong.<br><b>Aang</b>: Yeah right, (<i>He lies down on the bench without a care</i>) like we'll ever run into Jeong Jeong again.<br><b>Toph</b>: (<i>Cut to a sideview of a confused Toph</i>) Who's - Oh, (<i>She folds her arms irritably</i>) never mind. If it's important, I'll find out.<br><br>(<i>Cut to another wide shot of the Gaang from a different angle as Aang stands up with his glider in hand</i>)<br><br><b>Aang</b>: Oh well, guess we can't come up with anybody. Why don't we (<i>He jumps over Sokka's bench</i>) just take a nice tour (<i>He proceeds to run off screen as Momo follows him</i>) around the temple?<br><br>(<i>Cut to a shot of the mist as Aang's boot runs into screen and he unfolds his glider and leaps off the cliff. Momo flies into screen and joins his master in the mist as both of them fly upwards and off screen</i>.)<br><br><b>Toph</b>: (<i>off screen</i>) What's up with him? (<i>Cut to the remaining 3</i>)<br><b>Sokka</b>: There's got (<i>brings up his hands to his chin and thinks</i>) to be someone who can teach him firebending.<br><br>(<i>Katara and Toph look down dejectedly as the camera slowly pans up and fades to a smiling Zuko in a forested area</i>.)<br><br><b>Zuko</b>: Hello, (<i>raises an arm in greeting</i>) Zuko here. But I guess (<i>rubs his hand against the back of his head nervously</i>) you probably already know me... sort of. Uh...so, the thing is, (<i>He puts his arm down and looks to the side hesitantly</i>) I have a lot of firebending experience, and I'm (<i>places an arm on chest with pride</i>) considered to be pretty good at it. (<i>He</i> <i>continues smiling</i>) Well, you've seen me... you know, when I was attacking you? (<i>His eyes widen at his verbal mistake</i>) Uh, yeah...I guess (<i>places his fingers against his forehead in embarrassment</i>) I should apologize for that. But anyway, (<i>waves an arm to the side dismissively</i>) I'm good now. (<i>clenches both fists and places one on his chest while the other arm is raised</i>) I mean, I thought I was good before, but now I realize I was bad. (<i>He gets visibly uncomfortable and drops his arms into a slouch</i>) Ugh, but anyway... I think it's time I joined your group, and taught (<i>straightens up with a sincere expression on his face</i>) the Avatar firebending.<br><br>(<i>The camera slowly zooms in on him. Cut to a sideview of Zuko to reveal him talking to a badger frog sitting on a large log. The tarp from Zuko's war balloon can be seen in the background and it has been used as a form of shelter. Cut to a frontal shot of the badger frog as it croaks</i>.)<br><br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut to a close up of a frustrated Zuko</i>) Well, what's your answer?!<br><br>(<i>Cut to a sideview of Zuko as the frog ribbits and hops on Zuko's head before jumping off screen. Zuko slouches dejectedly.</i>)<br><br><b>Zuko</b>: Yeah, that's what I'd say too. (<i>Cut to a far shot of Zuko's campsite as he raises his arm to his head in despair</i>) How am I supposed to convince these people I'm on their side? What would Uncle do? (<i>He proceeds to imitate Iroh's voice and pretends to hold an imaginary beard on his chin as he starts pacing.)</i><br><br>"Zuko, you have to look within yourself, to save yourself (<i>He releases his finger and points</i>) from your other self. (<i>turns and paces in the opposite direction as he raises his finger as he pretends to be lecturing</i>) Only then will your true self reveal itself." (<i>Zuko sighs and presses a hand to his forehead</i>) Even when I'm talking for him, I can't figure out what he means. What would Azula do? (<i>Zuko raises the pitch of his voice and Azula's theme starts to play in the background.</i>)<br><br>"Listen, Avatar, I can join your group (<i>maneuvers his body into a position he thinks is feminine</i>) or I can do something unspeakably horrible (<i>folds his arms arrogantly</i>) to you and your friends. Your choice." (<i>stops and sits down</i>) I guess I'm not that good at impersonations.<br><br>(<i>The badger frog leaps in front of Zuko and croaks.

The wind is too loud in my ears. Check out this loop.<br><br>(<i>Cut to an overhead shot of the mist as Aang maneuvers his glider into a loop and Momo mimics his actions in perfect sync</i>.)<br><br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>straining his voice against the rushing wind</i>) Aang, (<i>Appa continues to fly behind Aang</i>) I think we should be making some plans about our future. (<i>Cut back to a shot of the hour glass fountain as Aang and Appa land on the platform.</i>)<br><b>Aang</b>: Ok, we can do that while I show you the giant Pai Sho table. (<i>Cut to a frontal shot of an excited Aang as the remainder of the Gaang descend from Appa behind him</i>) Oh, you're gonna love the all-day echo chamber.<br><b>Toph</b>: (<i>Cut to a close up of Toph as she turns serious</i>) I think that'll have to wait.<br><br>(<i>Camera zooms out to show the Gaang looking at her quizzically.

Appa then proceeds to lick his back. Cut to a surprised Momo and Aang as he lowers his staff slightly. Cut back to Zuko as Appa licks his face affectionately. Zuko wipes off the slobber with his arm.</i>)<br><br><b>Zuko</b>: I know you must be surprised to see me here. (<i>Cut to a sideview shot of the Gaang as they wear hostile expressions on their faces</i>)<br><b>Sokka</b>: Not really, since you've followed us all over the world.<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut to a visibly uncomfortable Zuko</i>) Right... Well, uh... anyway, what I wanted to tell you about is that I've changed, and I uh, (<i>Cut to a slight overhead shot behind Zuko as the camera slowly pans upwards to show the Gaang</i>) I'm good now. And, well, I think I should join your group.(<i>Cut to a close up of Zuko's apprehensive face</i>) Oh, and I can teach firebending... to you. (<i>Cut to a confused Aang as he lowers his staff further. Cut to Katara in disbelief. Cut back to Zuko</i>.) See, I uh...<br><b>Toph</b>: (<i>Cut to Toph as she interrupts Zuko. Sokka remains dumbfounded in the background</i>) You want to what now?! (<i>Camera pans down towards Katara and Sokka raises his fist in preparation for a fight</i>)<br><b>Katara</b>: You can't possibly think that any of us would trust you, can you? I mean, how stupid do you think we are?<br><b>Sokka</b>: Yeah, all you've ever done is try to hunt us down (<i>Cut to a sideview shot of Zuko</i>) and capture Aang.<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>defensive</i>) I've done some good things. (<i>walks forward</i>) I mean, I could've stolen your bison in Ba Sing Se, but I set him free. (<i>He thrusts both arms out towards Appa to prove his point</i>) That's something.<br><br>(<i>Appa licks Zuko's back to his surprise. Cut back to Toph, Katara and Sokka</i>.)<br><br><b>Toph</b>: Appa (<i>The siblings turn towards her</i>) does seem to like him. (<i>Brother and sister turn back angrily towards Zuko</i>)<br><b>Sokka</b>: He probably just covered himself in honey or something so that Appa would lick him. I'm not (<i>swipes his arm aside in a "No" gesture</i>) buying it.<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut to a remorseful Zuko with Appa licking its lips in the background)</i> I can understand why you wouldn't trust me, and I know I've made some mistakes (<i>looks to the side in shame</i>) in the past.<br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>off screen</i>) Like when you attacked our village?<br><b>Katara</b>: (<i>off screen</i>) Or when you stole my mother's necklace (<i>Cut to a sideview of the siblings</i>) and used it to track us down (<i>she takes a step forward with her fists clenched</i>) and capture us?<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut to a close up of his face</i>) Look, I admit I've done some awful things. I was wrong (<i>lowers his head down and presses a palm against his temple</i>) to try to capture you, and I'm sorry that I attacked the Water Tribe. (<i>Camera pans across the Gaang who are still not pleased with his presence</i>) And I never should've sent that Fire Nation assassin after you. (<i>Sokka and Toph widen their eyes in shock</i>) I'm gonna try to stop him.<br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>interrupts</i>) Wait, you sent (<i>unsheathes his boomerang and</i> <i>holds it towards Zuko</i>) Combustion Man after us?<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut back to a slightly panicking Zuko</i>) Well, that's not his name, but...<br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>off screen</i>) Oh, <i>sorry</i>. (<i>Cut back to a frontal shot of Toph and Sokka as he remains in a defensive position</i>) I didn't mean to insult your friend.<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>raising his voice</i>) He's not my friend!<br><b>Toph</b> <i>(Cut to a visibly angry Toph)</i> That guy (<i>points an accusing finger at Zuko</i>) locked me and Katara in jail and tried to blow us (<i>swipes her hand down audibly</i>) all up.<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut back to Zuko who closes his eyes and opens them as he angles his head diagonally</i>) Why aren't you saying anything? (<i>Cut to Aang's back with Zuko still in view</i>) You once said you thought we could be (<i>Zuko shrugs</i>) friends. (<i>Aang looks down to the side, pondering</i>) You know I (<i>Cut to a frontal shot of Aang as he remains deep in thought</i>) have good in me.<br><br>(<i>Aang looks towards the rest of the Gaang.

(<i>Katara starts walking into the chamber</i>)<br><b>Sokka</b>: Obviously, he wants to lead us into some kind of trap.<br><b>Katara</b>: This is just like when we were in prison together in Ba Sing Se. (<i>Cut to a sideview of the 3 to show the siblings each holding a sleeping bag while Aang holds a jar</i>) He starts talking about his mother, (<i>Aang proceeds to walk off screen</i>) and making it seem like he's an actual human being with feelings.<br><b>Sokka</b>: He wants you <i>(Katara turns towards him)</i> to trust him and feel sorry for him, so you let your guard down, <i>then</i> he strikes. (<i>punches his fist out</i>)<br><b>Katara</b>: (<i>Cut to a back view of Sokka with his sister still in sight</i>) The thing is, it worked. (<i>kneels and sets the sleeping bag down</i>) I did feel sorry for him. I felt like he was really confused and hurt. (<i>looks around</i>) But obviously when the time came, (<i>stands up)</i> he made his choice, and we paid the price. (<i>Cut to a close up of Katara as she turns angry</i>) We can't trust him.<br><b>Aang</b>: (<i>off screen</i>) I kind of (<i>Katara turns her head towards him</i>) have a confession to make.

It's <i>my</i> throatal flap. (<i>Cut to outside the chamber looking in at the Gaang</i>)<br><b>Aang</b>: Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up, it was <i>Zuko</i> (<i>the siblings turn towards him</i>) who came in and got me out. (<i>Cut to a close up of Aang's face</i>) He risked his life to save me. (<i>Cut to a sideview of the 3 as Katara steps forward</i>)<br><b>Katara</b>: No way, (<i>brings her arms up and thrusts them to the side</i>) I'm sure (<i>punches her fists down</i>) he only did it (<i>crosses her arms</i>) so he could capture you himself.<br><b>Sokka</b>: Yeah, (<i>steps towards Aang</i>) face it Aang. You're nothing but a big prize to him.<br><b>Aang</b>: You're probably right.<br><b>Katara</b>: And what was (<i>punches her fists down again</i>) all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free?

(<i>throws his arms up sarcastically)</i> In a lifetime of evil, at least (<i>brings his hands to his cheek and puts on a mocking friendly face</i>) he didn't add animal cruelty to the list. (<i>He brings his hands down and looks back at Toph angrily</i>)<br><b>Toph</b>: (<i>off screen</i>) I'm just saying that (<i>Cut back to Toph with an empathetic expression on her face</i>) considering his messed-up family, and how he was raised, he could've turned out a lot worse. (<i>Cut back to Aang and Katara</i>)<br><b>Katara</b>: You're right, (<i>thrusts her arms down as Aang looks towards her</i>) Toph, let's go find him (<i>raises her arms up</i>) and give him a medal. (<i>She says this with sarcasm</i>) The "not as much of a jerk as you could have been" award.<br><b>Toph</b>: (<i>Cut to a sideview of Toph with her arms crossed</i>) All I know is that while he was talking to us, he was sincere. Maybe (<i>brings an arm up with her palm facing upwards</i>) you're all just letting your hurt feelings keep you from thinking clearly.
