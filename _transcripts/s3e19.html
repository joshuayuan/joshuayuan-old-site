(<i>Cut to a close up of Roku</i>) All the past Avatars, all their experience and wisdom, (<i>he smiles</i>) is available to you (<i>Cut to Aang)</i> if you look deep inside yourself. <br><b>Aang</b>: (<i >looking around</i>) So where am I, Roku? What is this place? <br><b>Avatar Roku</b>: (<i>Cut to a puzzled Roku looking at the trees</i>) I... don't know, Aang. (<i>He looks back at Aang</i>) But (<i>Camera zooms in on the worried airbender</i>) I see that you are lost in more ways than one right now. <br><b>Aang</b>: I am.

Cut back to Aang talking to Roku at the hexagon.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: Everyone expects me to take the Fire Lord's life but I just don't know if I can do that. <br><b>Avatar Roku</b>: (<i>Camera slowly zooms in on Roku who closes his eyes</i>) In my life, I tried to be disciplined and show restraint. But it backfired when (<i>Cut to Sozin attacking Roku in The Avatar and the Fire Lord</i>) Fire Lord Sozin took advantage of my restraint and mercy. If I had been more decisive (<i>Cut to an aged Sozin looking at his fleet of soldiers and airships</i>) and acted sooner, I could have stopped Sozin (<i>Fade to 3 burning air temples seen in The Avatar and the Fire Lord)</i> and stop the war (<i>Fade to a close up of Sozin's face</i>) before it started. (<i>Cut back to the hexagon</i>) I offer you this wisdom, Aang.

(<i>Cut to an area behind the 4 men looking at the Gaang</i>) We're surrounded by old people. <br><b>Katara</b>: Not just any (<i>She walks towards the masters</i>) old people. These (<i>Cut to a sideview shot of the 4 men</i>) are great masters and friends of ours. (<i>Camera pans down to Pakku as Katara stops in front of him and bows</i>) Pakku.<br><b>Pakku</b>: (<i>Bowing in return</i>) It is respectful to bow to an old master but how about a hug (<i>opens his arms</i>) for your new grandfather? (<i>Cut to a close up of shocked Katara with an equally dumbfounded Sokka behind her. Katara's expression changes into happiness</i>)<br><b>Katara</b>: That's so exciting. (<i>She opens her arms and embraces Pakku</i>) You and Gran Gran must be so happy to have found each other again. <br><b>Pakku</b>: I made her a (<i>He touches an area below his collar bone</i>) new betrothal necklace and everything. (<i>Sokka comically enters the screen and hugs Pakku by the neck)</i><br><b>Sokka</b>: Welcome to the family Great Gramp. <br><b>Pakku</b>: You can still just call me (<i>He pushes Sokka off him</i>) Pakku. <br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i >Cut to Sokka who smiles goofily</i>) How about Grand Pakku? <br><b>Pakku</b>: (<i>Cut to a serious Pakku</i>) No. (<i>Camera pans out to show a disappointed Sokka</i>)<br><b>Katara</b>: And this was (<i>Camera pans up to show Jeong Jeong as Katara introduces Zuko to him</i>) Aang's first firebending teacher.

(<i>Bumi comically exits the screen</i>)<br><b>Jeong Jeong</b>: The White Lotus has always been about philosophy, and beauty and truth. (<i>Cut to an overhead shot of the scene</i>) About a month ago, a call went out that we were needed for something important. <br><b>Pakku</b>: (<i>Cut to an area behind Zuko's shoulder looking at Pakku and Katara</i>) It came from a Grand Lotus, your Uncle, (<i>Cut to a close up of a smiling Zuko</i>) Iroh of the Fire Nation. (<i>Camera pans out to show Toph behind him</i>)<br><b>Toph</b>: Well that's who we're looking for. <br><b>Piandao</b>: (<i >Cut back to a frontal shot of Jeong Jeong and Piandao again</i>) Then we'll take you to him.<br><b>Bumi</b>: (<i>Bumi pushes apart their shoulders</i>) Wait, someone's (<i>looking around warily</i>) missing from your group.

(<i>More memories of Kyoshi creating Kyoshi Island is shown</i>) I stopped him and the World entered a great era of peace. <br><b>Aang</b>: (<i >voice over</i>) But you didn't really kill Chin, (<i>A memory of Chin falling to his death is shown</i>) technically he fell to his own doom because (<i>Cut back to present day Aang</i>) he was too stubborn to get out of the way.<br><b>Avatar Kyoshi</b>: (<i>Cut to a close up side view of a serious Kyoshi</i>) Personally I don't really see the difference but I assure you, I would have done whatever it took to <i>stop</i> Chin. (<i>Switch to Aang's point of view looking at Kyoshi</i>) I offer you this wisdom, Aang. (<i>She begins to slowly shrink into white puff of smoke</i>) Only justice will bring peace.

I didn't escape, everybody else escaped. (<i>He throws his arms into the air</i>) There I was, (<i>Cut to a close up frontal shot of Bumi</i>) back in Omashu, waiting for <i>just</i> the right (<i>flashback to a view looking at Omashu from the outside with the Fire Nation banner still hanging at the entrance of the city</i>) moment. I didn't know (<i>Cut to a close up frontal shot of Bumi's head peeking out of the porthole in the coffin seen in Return to Omashu</i>) what or when but I knew I'd know it when I knew it.
