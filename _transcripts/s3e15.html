I'm sure (<i>Cut to a side view of the warden as he walks down the line</i>) you've all heard the horrible rumors about our little island. Well I just want to tell you that they don't have to be true. As long as you (<i>stops in front of Hakoda who is looking down</i>) do everything I say. Look me (<i>closes in on Hakoda's face</i>) in the eye when I'm talking to you. <br><b>Hakoda</b>: (<i>His eyes looks to the side</i>) No. <br><b>Warden</b>: (<i>Cut to an area behind Hakoda</i>) Oh, you'd rather look at my shoes?

(<i>Cut back to inside the cell</i>) Where's everyone else from the invasion?<br><b>Hakoda</b>: (<i>Cut to Hakoda sitting on the floor, looking at his son</i>) The others are being held at a prison near the Fire Nation palace. They singled me out as their leader and sent me here. (<i>Sokka walks into screen and sits beside his Dad</i>) But before I left I met some young women who said they knew you. The Yoshinama Fighters?<br><b>Sokka</b>: You mean the Kyoshi Warriors?<br><b>Hakoda</b>: That's right. <br><b>Sokka</b>: Their leader Suki is here and she's gonna escape with us. <br><b>Hakoda</b>: Good, (<i>lays a hand on his son's shoulder</i>) we'll need all the help we can get. <br><b>Sokka</b>: And you know Prince Zuko?<br><b>Hakoda</b>: The son of the Firelord? I don't know him, but I knew of him. <br><b>Sokka</b>: Well, he's here too. <br><b>Hakoda</b>: (<i>crosses his arms and starts to think</i>) Sounds like a major problem. <br><b>Sokka</b>: Actually, he's on our side now. (<i >Cut to Hakoda who looks at Sokka sceptically</i>) I know, I had the same reaction. After all he has done, it was hard to trust him. But he's really proven himself and I never would have found you without his help. (<i>Camera zooms out on the pair as Hakoda nods his head</i>) <br><b>Hakoda</b>: So, do you have a plan? <br><b>Sokka</b>: We had one (<i>looks away</i>) but some of the other prisoners got involved and ruined it. (<i>sets  his head on his knees</i>) I don't know if<br>there's another way off this island. <br><b>Hakoda</b>: Sokka, (<i>pats his son's back</i>) there's no prison in the World that can hold two Water Tribe geniuses. <br><b>Sokka</b>: Then we'd better find two. <br><br>(<i>Hakoda laughs.

That's why. <br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>Cut back to Sokka who smiles</i>) Could I just get ten more seconds to rough him up a bit? (<i>punches his right fist into his left palm)</i><br><b>Female Guard</b>: (<i>crosses her arms and leans against the railing</i>) Fine, ten seconds. <br><br>(<i>The male guard crosses his arms as well.

There was another person involved in the escape plan. <br><b>Warden</b>: (<i>places a hand on Chit Sang's shoulder</i>) Who? <br><b>Chit Sang</b>: It's a guy who's disguised like a prison guard, only he's not a prison guard. He's the mastermind. He came up with the plan. <br><br>(<i>The warden pats Chit Sang's head and walks away. Camera slowly zooms in on Chit Sang's face. Cut to commercial break</i>.)<br><br><br><br><b><u>Act II</u></b><br><br>(<i>Scene returns to Zuko sitting down in a chair with his head down.

(<i>Cut to Zuko who brings his hand to his forehead and groans</i>) The<br>truth is, (<i>Mai's glove hand comes into screen and she unrolls a letter</i>) I guess I don't know you. All I get is a letter. (<i>Cut to a side view of the scene to show Mai with her hands outstretched at the side</i>) You could have at<br>least looked me in the eye when you ripped out my heart. <br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut to Zuko who looks at her apologetically</i>) I didn't mean to... <br><b>Mai</b>: (<i>interrupts</i>) You didn't mean to? (<i>she walks behind Zuko to read out the contents of the letter</i>) Dear Mai, I'm sorry that you have to find out this way, but I'm leaving. <br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>harshly</i>) Stop! (<i>looks back at Mai</i>) This isn't about you. This is about the Fire Nation. <br><b>Mai</b>: Thanks Zuko. That makes me feel all better. (<i>she throws the letter at his head. Zuko grabs his head and rubs the spot she threw the letter at.</i>)<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut to a side view of the couple</i>) Mai, I never wanted to hurt you. (<i>gets up from his chair and faces Mai</i>) But I have to do this to save my country. <br><b>Mai</b>: Save it?

(<i>Cut to the outside of the opening looking into the room</i>) If I'm seen with you (<i>Sokka looks out of the<br>opening</i>) the guards might think something's up. (<i>he lowers his visor before pushing back up again</i>) I just talked to my Dad. <br><br>(<i>Cut back to a side shot of the couple inside of the room.</i>)<br><br><b>Suki</b>: That's great. <br><b>Sokka</b>: Yeah and we're escaping today. On the gondola. <br><b>Suki</b>: (<i>confused</i>) What? <br><b>Sokka</b>: My dad and I came up with a plan together. We're gonna commandeer the gondola and (<i>places both hands on Suki's shoulders</i>) we're gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines. <br><b>Suki</b>: (<i>lowers Sokka's arms</i>) We'll never make it onto the gondola. There's too many guards. <br><b>Sokka</b>: My dad already thought of that. He said we'll need a distraction. That's why we're gonna start a prison riot. <br><b>Suki</b>: (<i>Cut back to Suki who looks skeptical</i>) Okay. Let's say by some miracle this all works and we make it on the gondola. The Warden will still just cut the lines, even if we have a captive. <br><b>Sokka</b>: Not if the Warden <i>is</i> the captive. (<i>A sound from outside the cell stops their conversation. Sokka peers at the opening</i>.) I have to go. (<i>Suki rushes into screen and hugs him)</i> I'll find you before we start the riot. <br><br>(<i>Cut to an overhead shot of the room as he hugs back.

(<i>points to Sokka</i>)<br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>turns back</i>) Why? <br><b>Male Guard</b>: I don't know. I didn't ask. <br><b>Sokka</b>: Maybe I could schedule another time with him? How's tomorrow? (<i>he walks off</i>)<br><b>Male Guard</b>: He wants to see you, (<i>Sokka comes back on screen as 2 other guards hold his hands behind his back and leads him away</i>) now.<br><br>(<i>Cut to an overhead shot outside with a line of guards standing in front of the Warden.)</i><br><br><b>Warden</b>: Put him in the line up.<br><br><i>(Cut to show the line of guards without their helmets.

(<i>Cut to the warden who smiles. Cut back to the bully guard who grabs Chit Sang by his shirt</i>) I am not. He's lying!

I know you've been working together. (<i>The warden comes close to the guard's face</i>) You threw Chit Sang in the very cooler they used to escape. It was all part of your plan. <br><b>Bully Guard</b>: That was just a coincidence. <br><b>Guard</b>: (<i>the door opens and a voice sounds off screen</i>) Sir, there's someone to see you. <br><b>Warden</b>: (<i>turns his head to the door</i>) Who told you to interrupt me! (<i>his eyes widen and camera cuts to an area in the room facing the door. Azula is standing at the doorway. The guards bow down in respect</i>)<br><b>Azula</b>: I did.

I didn't realize (<i>stands up)</i> you were coming. <br><b>Azula</b>: (<i>walks in some more</i>) Who is this?<br><b>Warden</b>: (<i>Cut to the guard who looks at the warden and then looks away</i>) He's a guard who was involved in a recent and feeble escape attempt. <br><b>Bully Guard</b>: It wasn't me. (<i>Cut to an area behind the guard's head</i>)<br><b>Warden</b>: Quiet you. (<i>points to the guard</i>)<br><b>Azula</b>: You're wasting your time.

(<i>he</i><i> waves his hand dismissively and walks off)</i> I'll just go tell the Warden you said that. I'm sure (<i>the guard raises his visor</i>) he'll be <i>glad</i> to hear about you undermining his authority. (<i>Sokka comically enters back into screen, raising his visor</i>) What's your name again? (<i>The guard perspires nervously as Sokka disappears off screen</i>) <br><b>Guard</b>: (<i>throws his arm out</i>) Wait. Don't tell the Warden, I... I'm just a little confused. <br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>Cut to an overhead shot of the room</i>) Hey, I'm confused too. (<i>turns< back to the guard</i>) But the Warden's in a bad mood and irrational. So if you ask me, (<i>puts an arm on the guard's shoulder and turns him towards the controls</i>) it's best not to question it and just do what he<br>says. <br><b>Guard</b>: Yeah, you're right.
