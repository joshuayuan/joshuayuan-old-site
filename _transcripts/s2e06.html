A few mountains rise in the distance. Cut to a street corner scene, then cut to a close up shot of a green bag with a shoulder strap.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> It's pricey, but I really do like it.<br><br><i>(Camera zooms backward to reveal the three kids in an open air shop. Sokka is looking at the bag. Katara, with Momo on her shoulder, looks at him with some concern. Aang sits on the floor, looking somewhat bored and unhappy.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> Then you should get it. You deserve something nice.<br><b>Sokka:</b> <i>(turns to her with a smile)</i> I do, don't I? <i>(turns back with an exaggerated gesture)</i> But no. It's too expensive, I shouldn't.<br><b>Katara:</b> <i>(slightly annoyed)</i> Alright, then don't.<br><br><i>(She turns and walks out of the frame. Aang gets up and follows her. Sokka goes last, looking wistfully back at the bag. The frame is empty for a moment before Sokka returns and stands behind the bag, his hands clasped in front of him. Sight Gag: Sokka's face goes slightly chibi as he smiles at the bag.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka:</b> You know what? I'm gonna get it.<br><br><i>(Cut to a wide shot of Katara and Aang standing in the street. A man nears with a paper in his hand turns around and speaks to them.)</i><br><br><b>Man:</b> Psst, psst. Hey, you kids like earthbending? You like throwing rocks? Then check out Master Yu's Earthbending Academy.<br><br><i>(He hands Aang a flyer with a smile and leaves. Cut to a close up of the flyer. Aang flips it over to reveal the other side.)</i><br><br><b>Aang:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> Look, there's a coupon on the back. The first lesson is free.<br><br><i>(Cut to a wider shot of the two.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> Who knows? This Master Yu could be the earthbending teacher you've been looking for.<br><br><i>(Sokka enters the frame from the right, the green bag cradled in his arms.</i><br><br><i>Quick fade to the front gate of a dojo compound. The gate is a paifang with a large green sign with Chinese characters written across it.</i><br><br><i>Cut to a shot tilting up of Aang in a dark green earthbender training uniform and a round helmet. He looks confused. He picks his ear with his finger, then sniffs his finger. Cut to a zooming back shot of Aang from the p.o.v. of the end of the line of boys of which he is a member. The boys are younger and smaller than he is by a head. They stand resolute, looking forward. Aang stands up straight in imitation of them.</i><br><br><i>Shift to a wide shot of the compound. On the left is a line of four boys with a stone in front of them. On the right is a line of fours boys, including Aang without any stones. A man, Master Yu, enters the frame in the foreground, only his back visible to the camera.)</i><br><br><b>Yu:</b> Take your stances.<br><br><i>(The students except Aang assume earthbending stances. He walks between the two lines then cut to a closer shot of him.)</i><br><br><b>Yu:</b> Now, strike as if you're punching through your opponents head!<br><br><i>(Master Yu strikes a pose as he says this, then cut to a wide shot of Yu and the two lines facing each other. The line on the lift their rocks and throws them at the line on the right.</i><br><br><i>Cut to a close up of Aang looking alarmed, then a split second close up of the boy across from Aang chucking the rock at him. The rock hits Aang square in the chest and knocks him backwards into a large ceramic pot behind him. The pot explodes in a cloud of dust and fragments.</i><br><br><i>Cut to Aang's p.o.v. amidst the wreckage. Master Yu approaches him with a smile.)</i><br><br><b>Yu:</b> So, are you ready to commit to more lessons? <i>(Cut to a closer shot of Yu)</i> If you pay for the whole year in advance, I'll bump you up to the next belt.<br><br><i>(Shift back to Aang, buried in the rubble. His face is covered as more debris slides down over him. </i><br><br><i>Cut to a wide shot of Aang excited the dojo through the paifang gate. Sokka and Katara sit just outside.)</i><br><br><b>Aang:</b> <i>(disappointed)</i> He's not the one.<br><br><i>(Aang leans over and pats one side of his head, ejecting bits of dirt from his ear. The last two boys exit the gate and their conversation is heard.)</i><br><br><b>Student 1:</b> I think The Boulder is gonna win back the belt at Earth Rumble 6.<br><b>Student 2:</b> He's gonna <i>(cut to a close up of Aang's face)</i> have to fight his way through the best earthbenders in the world to even get a shot at the champ.<br><b>Aang:</b> Excuse me, <i>(runs over to the boys, cut to wider shot of the three)</i> but where is this earthbending tournament exactly? <br><b>Student 1:</b> It's on the Island of Noneoya - none o' ya business! <br><br><i>(Both laugh and walk away. Cut back to Aang, Sokka and Katara visible behind him. Sokka begins to laugh as he and his sister walk up behind Aang. Katara looks peeved at the boys' treatment of Aang.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka:</b> Ha, ha! Oh, I got to remember that one.<br><br><i>(Katara smiles and puts her hands on Aang's shoulder and left arm.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> <i>(in a comforting tone)</i> I'll take care of this.<br><br><i>(Cut to a view down the street and the right turn into a side street where the two boys disappeared into. Katara runs into the frame, waving her right hand in the air.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> Hey strong guys, wait up!<br><br><i>(Katara disappears around the corner. Cut to Aang and Sokka, who holds out his new bag in disdain.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka:</b> What was I thinking? I don't need a new bag. Why'd you let me buy this? <br><br><i>(Sokka drops the bag and folds his arms crossly. Momo, perched on Sokka's shoulder, looks down at the bag. He jumps down into the bag. Cut to a close shot of Momo settling in for some sleep, chittering happily. Cut back to a wider shot as Katara runs back into the frame.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> You ready to find an earthbending teacher? Because we're going to Earth Rumble 6!<br><b>Aang:</b> How did you get them to tell you?<br><b>Katara:</b> Oh, <i>(looks over her shoulder coyly)</i> a girl has her ways.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of the two boys looking down at the camera. They are frozen from the neck down. Shift to a wider shot. Their feet are frozen to the walls of the buildings that line each side of the street. Their heads touch each other and together they form a gate or archway over the street.</i><br><br><i>Fade to a night scene in the mountains. In the distance at the bottom of the frame is the brightly lit entrance to a cave. People are lined up to enter.</i><br><br><i>Cut to an underground stadium with a wide shot of the rectangular earthbending arena. The center of the arena is dominated by a large stone circle with a square punched out of its center. In the background on the lift is a tower atop which the master of the games announces the matches. Around the rest of the arena are the stands. There is an empty space all around the arena between it and the stands.</i><br><br><i>Shift to a closer shot of the stands. They are empty in the immediate vicinity as the three kids enter the frame from the left.)</i><br><br><b>Aang:</b> Hey, front row seats! I wonder why no one else is sitting here.<br><br><i>(They sit down. A moment later the camera zooms backward as a massive boulder slams into the seats to their right, showering them with dust and debris.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka:</b> I guess that's why.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot from just behind the three kids looking at the arena. A man earthbends a mighty explosion of rock and dirt at its center. A huge column of earth begins to raise the man upwards. It stops rising. The man motions and the column collapses back to floor level. Cut to a close of the man's face. It is strong, cruel, and mostly obscured by long, luxurious black hair.)</i><br><br><b>Xin Fu:</b> Welcome to Earth Rumble 6! <i>(cut to wide, panning right shot of the arena, Xin Fu continues in voice over)</i> I am your host, Xin Fu!<br><br><i>(Cut to a frontal shot of the kids. Aang, Sokka and Momo look at the arena, while Katara has turned sideways and adopted a bored pose.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> This is just gonna be a bunch of guys chuckin' rocks at each other, isn't it?<br><b>Sokka:</b> <i>(hopefully)</i> That's what I paid for.<br><br><i>(Cut back to Xin Fu.)</i><br><br><b>Xin Fu:</b> The rules are simple. Just knock the other guy out of the ring and you win. <br><br><i>(He earthbends himself back to the announcer's tower and continues in voice over. Cut to a muscular earthbender with a tattoo on his back. He raises his arms in a salute to the crowd and grins confidently.)</i><br><br><b>Xin Fu:</b> Round one! The Boulder <i>(cut to a long shot of The Boulder as a huge foot crashes onto the floor in the foreground. Cut to a frontal shot of a huge fat man)</i> versus The Big Bad Hippo! <i>(cut to a close up of the Hippo, who opens his mouth to reveal four hippo like teeth as he roars.)</i><br><b>Boulder:</b> <i>(in exaggerated, WWF type voice)</i> Listen up, Hippo. You may be big, but you ain't bad! <i>(grinning insanely)</i> The Boulder's gonna win this in a landslide.<br><br><i>(Cut to a frontal shot of the Hippo, who raises his arms high in the air.)</i><br><br><b>Hippo:</b> Hippo mad!<br><br><i>(The Boulder earthbends a boulder at the Hippo, who catches part of it in his mouth, crushes it and spits it out. The Hippo then begins to jump up and down. His enormous bulk actually causes the arena to shake around. The Boulder wobbles backwards on the verge of losing his balance.)</i><br><br><b>Xin Fu:</b> Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen! The Hippo is rocking The Boulder! <br><br><i>(As The Boulder reaches the edge of the arena, he earthbends a sheet of rock out of the side of the arena and throws it at his opponent. It hits the Hippo's back and he turns around to face the Boulder once more. The Boulder, with a tremendous effort, then earthbends the Hippo off the floor and throws him over the side of the arena.)</i><br><br><b>Xin Fu:</b> The Boulder wins!<br><br><i>(Cut to a wide shot from behind the three kids. The Boulder raises his arms in victory. Cut to an off angle shot of Aang and Katara. She turns to him questioningly.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> How about The Boulder? He's got some good moves.<br><b>Aang:</b> <i>(hesitantly)</i> I don't know. Bumi said I need a teacher who listens to the earth. He's just listening to his big muscles. What do you think, Sokka?<br><br><i>(Shot widens to show Sokka in the foreground.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka:</b> <i>(excitedly)</i> Ha ha! Whoo!<br><br><i>(Cut to a long shot from the arena looking up at Xin Fu atop the tower.)</i><br><br><b>Xin Fu:</b> Next, The Boulder versus <i>(cut to a shot of Fire Nation Man waving the Fire Nation flag and smiling, Xin Fu continues in voice over)</i> Fire Nation Man!<br><br><i>(The crowd boos audibly as Fire Nation Man walks across a stone bridge to the arena floor waving his flag. The bridge crumbles behind him. Cut back to Sokka.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka:</b> <i>(giving thumbs down)</i> Boo! Boo!<br><br><i>(Cut back to wide shot of Fire Nation Man holding the flag upright and addressing the crowd.)</i><br><br><b>Fire Nation Man:</b> Please to rise for Fire Nation national anthem. <i>(singing)</i> Fire Lord, my flame <i>(drops to his knees)</i> burns for thee!<br><br><i>(Crowd boos and throws small stones at him. Cut to Sokka with a stone cocked back in his hand, ready to throw.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka:</b> Go back to the Fire Nation!<br><br><i>(He throws the stone, which hits Fire Nation Man on the head. His anger is cut short as he is twisted violently around and sinks into the earthen floor of the arena. In a flash he is buried up to shoulders in the arena floor. Cut to a shot from behind Fire Nation Man's buried figure. He stares ahead at The Boulder, who raises himself up on a huge column of earth. </i><br><br><i>Cut to a shot looking down at Fire Nation Man, who looks petrified.)</i><br><br><b>Fire Nation Man:</b> No. No please!<br><br><i>(Cut to the Boulder atop of the column, who grins and jumps off. He sails downward with his legs bent at the knees so he can hold his feet with his hands. He hits the ground in front of Fire Nation Man, who is hurled high into the air and out of the arena on impact. Cut to a shot of the kids and the rock that hit near them earlier. A second later Fire Nation Man flies into the picture and slams into the rock.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka:</b> <i>(looking at Fire Nation Man's impact point)</i> Yeah! Whoo! The Boulder knows how to put the hurt in the dirt! <i>(cut to a close up of Sokka looking insane and making taunting faces)</i> Yeah! Whoo!<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of a guy driving a badger mole across the arena. The badger mole uses his claws and earthbending powers to act as a zamboni, clearing up the arena for the next fight. Carnival type music plays in the background. Cut to a quick shot of an attractive woman in a white, sleeveless dress waltz across the screen bearing a placard for the crowd to see.</i><br><br><i>Several matches now pass by in rapid succession. The Boulder defeats every contestant he faces. The first is a gopher type guy who tunnels under the ground and bursts out in quick attacks. The next is a thin guy in a green mask who goes shirtless. The third is a guy with a painted face. Each is depicted in defeat with a stylized still that looks like a frame from a comic book. After the last is defeated, switch to a long shot of the announcer's tower.)</i><br><br><b>Xin Fu:</b> Now, the moment you've all been waiting for. The Boulder <i>(cut to a shot of short person with black hair mostly obscured by a green prize belt)</i> versus your champion...<br><br><i>(The views tilts down, the looks up to reveal a young girl with milk white eyes. She wears a green cape and a simple, but attractive green and white earthbending uniform. On her head she has a black and green headband. Above her head show holds the green prize belt.)</i><br><br><b>Xin Fu:</b> The Blind Bandit!<br><br><i>(The crowd chants "bandit" as the screen expands to reveal two young women next to the Bandit who remove her cape and take the belt. Cut to a shot of Aang and Katara.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> She can't really be blind. <i>(cut to a close up of the Bandit's eyes that pans right)</i> It's just part of her character, right? <br><br><i>(Cut back to Aang and Katara.)</i><br><br><b>Aang:</b> I think she is.<br><br><i>(Screen expands to show Sokka.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka:</b> I think she is... <i>(yells)</i> going down!<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of the Bandit. The camera rapidly zooms backward to a wide shot. The Boulder's foot crashes down in the foreground, then cut to a front shot of The Boulder.)</i><br><br><b>Boulder:</b> The Boulder feels conflicted about fighting a young, blind girl.<br><b>Toph:</b> <i>(pointing at the Boulder and in a mocking tone)</i> Sounds to me like you're scared, Boulder.<br><b>Boulder:</b> <i>(after a pause where he looks stung)</i> The Boulder's over his conflicted feelings, and now he's ready to bury you <i>(screen expands instantly and the Boulder makes a dramatic, crushing gesture)</i> in a rock-a-lanche!<br><b>Toph:</b> <i>(points again at her opponent)</i> Whenever you're ready...The Pebble. <i>(throws her head back)</i> Ha ha ha!<br><br><i>(Cut back to a close up of Aang, then to a flashback from "The Swamp" where he saw the girl in white and the flying boar. He remembers her laugh. It is the same as the Bandit's. The flashback shows a closer shot of the girl in the fancy dress. The camera closes in and turns around the girl to reveal her face. It is the Bandit's. The flashback ends in a flash of white to reveal Aang's stunned face.)</i><br><br><b>Boulder:</b> It's on!<br><br><i>(Cut back to a shot from behind The Boulder who faces the Bandit, then shift to a tilting down shot of The Boulder's head. Despite his bravado, he is sweating profusely.</i><br><br><i>Switch to a frontal shot of the Bandit. The camera whirls around her head and ends with a close up shot of her ear.</i><br><br><i>Cut back to The Boulder, who yells and takes a step forward. As his heel hits the ground, the frame freezes and goes to black and white. Shock waves in white move out from his heel where it is has struck the floor of the arena. Cut to an overhead shot of The Boulder showing the shock wave emanating away from his heel in neat concentric circles. Cut again to the Bandit standing perfectly still. The shock wave reaches her and travels up her body.</i><br><br><i>Return to a frontal shot of the Bandit in full color. She moves forward and opens her arms as soon as she registers the shock wave indicating the movement of her opponent. Cut to a shot of her feet as she moves forward to finish the set up for her attack. The Boulder moves forward at a slow frame rate. He is bellowing a battle cry, but it is slurred due to the slow frame rate. Cut to a wider shot of The Boulder. As his foot strikes the ground again, the screen flashes black and white again as another shock wave is shown moving out from him. Cut back to a frontal shot of the Bandit who has begin to swing her right foot in an arc towards the ground in font of her. As she strikes the ground, the view cuts to a wide shot from behind and above her right shoulder. The frame rate speeds up to normal. Her strike creates a shock waves in the arena floor that churns up the ground and heads toward the Boulder in a straight line as if a gopher were tunneling toward him at great speed.</i><br><br><i>We see a quick shot of Aang staring incredulously at the camera, his face turning to follow the Bandit's shock wave travel o.c. in front of him.</i><br><br><i>Cut back to a frontal shot of the Boulder whose foot meets the shock wave just as he puts it back on the ground. The shock wave makes him drop down onto the ground in a perfect split. Cut to briefly to Momo and Sokka. Momo squeaks and Sokka's look of adulation and excitement turns to a look of pain. Cut back to a close shot from above The Boulder. He looks up into the camera with a look of excruciating pain on his face.)</i><br><br><b>Boulder:</b> <i>(in pain)</i> Ooh!<br><br><i>(Cut back to the Bandit who makes a chopping motion with her right hand. Three stalagmites erupt from the ground near The Boulder and eject him from the ring. He slams into the wall beneath the stands and slides down into the crevice between the arena and the stands.</i><br><br><i>Shift to a close up of the Bandit's face, which softens into a crafty and satisfied smile as Xin Fu speaks.)</i><br><br><b>Xin Fu:</b> <i>(voice over)</i> Your winner, <i>(cut to wider shot of the Bandit, who raises her right fist in victory)</i> and still the champion, The Blind Bandit!<br><br><i>(Cut back to Aang and Sokka.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka:</b> <i>(crying)</i> No!<br><br><i>(Camera zooms back to show Katara as well. Sokka slumps in the background.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> <i>(incredulously)</i> How did she do that?<br><br>(Cut to a close up of Aang.)<br><br><b>Aang:</b> She waited, <i>(turns to Katara)</i> and listened.<br><br><i>(Cut to a wide shot of the announcer's tower as Xin Fu jumps from it to the arena floor. He holds a green bag in his left hand.)</i><br><br><b>Xin Fu:</b> To make things a little more interesting, I'm offering up this sack of gold pieces to anyone who can defeat <i>(he motions toward the champion)</i> The Blind Bandit! What No one dares to face her?<br><b>Aang:</b> I will!<br><br><i>(Xin Fu looks worried for a moment, before a cut to Aang onto the arena. The crowd murmurs its approval. Shift to a long, wide shot of Aang closing the distance between he and the Bandit. Xin Fu jumps out of the screen. Cut to Sokka and Katara.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka:</b> <i>(cupping his hands to his mouth)</i> Go Aang! Avenge The Boulder!<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot from behind Aang. The Bandit is in front of him.)</i><br><br><b>Toph:</b> Do people really want to see two little girls fighting out here?<br><br><i>(The crowd goes "ooooh" at this bit of taunting. Aang puts his hands up in a conciliatory gesture.)</i><br><br><b>Aang:</b> I don't really want to fight you. I want to talk to you.<br><br><i>(Cut to Sokka and Katara.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka:</b> Boo! No talking!<br><b>Katara:</b> <i>(smacking her brother)</i> Don't boo at him!<br><br><i>(Cut to Aang's feet. He takes a step, then cut back to the Bandit, who smiles as soon as his foot hits the ground. She stomps the ground with the side of her left foot. A shock wave travels across the ground and causing a large rock to grow out of the ground underneath Aang, who is launched into the air. He lands softly on the ground behind her. She turns around with an upset expression on her face.)</i><br><br><b>Toph:</b> Somebody's a little light on his feet. What's your fighting name, <i>(cut to Aang, the Bandit continues in voice over)</i> The Fancy Dancer?<br><br><i>(Aang smiles and shrugs his shoulders. Another rock erupts from the ground and launches Aang into the air. He somersaults through the air.)</i><br><br><b>Toph:</b> Where'd you go?<br><br><i>(Aang lands behind her.)</i><br><br><b>Aang:</b> Please, wait!<br><b>Toph:</b> There you are!<br><br><i>(She turns quickly, raises a boulder and throws at him in a straight line, like a bullet. The crowd cheers. Cut to Aang's p.o.v. as the rock approaches him rapidly. He jumps into the air, turns and airbends the rock backwards. Cut to a shot from behind the bandit. She and the rock are blown backward and off the arena. Quick shots of Xin Fu, The Boulder, and the Water Tribe siblings confirm their collective shock. Cut back to Aang, who looks around in surprise as the crowd cheers.</i><br><br><i>Cut to a shot of the Bandit walking away from the base of the arena. In the background is a set of stairs. Aang is at the top of the stairs and he calls after the former champion.)</i><br><br><b>Aang:</b> Please listen! I need an earthbending teacher, and I think it's supposed to be you.<br><b>Toph:</b> Whoever you are, just leave me alone.<br><br><i>(She opens a door in the wall with a stomp of her foot. She enters, turns and closes the door with a motion of her hands.)</i><br><br><b>Aang:</b> Wait!<br><br><i>(Aang reaches the wall too late. He turns and looks sad. Cut to Xin Fu holding the belt and the bag of gold, the crowd cheering behind them. Katara and Sokka enter the frame from the right. Sokka hugs Xin Fu and takes the money and the belt. He puts his arm around Aang's shoulder, but the Avatar is still morose.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka:</b> Way to go, champ!<br><br><i>(Aang's head droops in sadness, then cut to black for commercial.)</i><br><br><br><br><b><u>Act II</u></b><br><br><i>(The show returns to a brief shot of the village nestled amongst the mountains before cutting to the kids walking down a street. Cut to a frontal shot of Sokka, who is wearing both his new bag and the tournament belt.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka:</b> I gotta admit, now I'm really glad I bought this bag. It matches the belt perfectly.<br><b>Katara:</b> <i>(sarcastically)</i> That is a big relief.<br><b>Aang:</b> If we want to find The Blind Bandit, the Earthbending Academy is a good place to start.<br><br><i>(They enter the gate of Master Yu's academy once again. Cut to a few shots of the two boys Katara froze punching dirt contained in two huge pots. They look up as the kids enter.) </i><br><br><b>Student 1:</b> Oh great, you again.<br><br><i>(Cut to a frontal shot of the kids. Katara, between Sokka and Aang, looks forward and looks mean. The two students flinch backwards in fright.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> Yeah, I didn't think so.<br><b>Sokka:</b> Nicely done.<br><b>Student 2:</b> Hey, <i>(walking towards Aang)</i> you're the kid who beat The Blind Bandit.<br><b>Aang:</b> We need to talk to her. Do you guys know where she lives?<br><b>Student 1:</b> The Blind Bandit's a mystery. She shows up to fight, then disappears.<br><br><i>(Aang looks disappointed. Katara notices and puts a hand on his shoulder.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> Let me handle this. <i>(pointing at student #2 and saying angrily)</i> You're not telling us everything!<br><b>Student 2:</b> <i>(hands up)</i> No no, I swear it's true! No one knows where she goes, or who she really is.<br><b>Aang:</b> <i>(almost lost in thought)</i> That's because we're asking about the wrong person. In my vision, I saw a girl in a white dress with a pet flying boar. Know anybody like that?<br><br><i>(Cut back to a frontal shot of the two students. Student # 2 now hides behind student #1.)</i><br><br><b>Student 1:</b> Well, a flying boar is the symbol of the Bei Fong family. They're the richest people in town, probably the whole world.<br><b>Student 2:</b> Yeah, but they don't have a daughter.<br><b>Aang:</b> Flying boar is good enough for me. <i>(to his friends)</i> Let's check it out.<br><br><i>(Cut to a profile shot of the faces of the two students. They try to look tough.)</i><br><br><b>Student 1:</b> <i>(quietly)</i> Yeah, you better leave.<br><br><i>(Cut to Katara turning as she exits the compound. She put two fingers up to her eyes.)</i><br><br><b>Katara:</b> Hey, I've got my eye on you.<br><br><i>(Katara exits as Sokka enters the frame, his arms out like an airplane.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka:</b> <i>(whispers with a smile)</i> Water Tribe.<br><br><i>(He exits. Cut to two figures standing at the opening of a tunnel. They are silhouetted by the light coming in from outside the cave, though it does not look like sunlight. It would appear they stand at an entrance into the arena.)</i><br><br><b>Boulder:</b> I'm telling you, The Boulder was standing right there. I saw the kid strike, but there was no earthbending. <i>(cut to a frontal shot of The Boulder and Xin Fu)</i> Nothing made contact. The Blind Bandit just fell out of the ring. She must have took a dive and split the money with the kid.<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of Xin Fu's dist banging into the wall of the cave exit. Rocks falls down onto his foot. He screams, then recovers, his expression angry.)</i><br><br><b>Xin Fu:</b> Nobody cheats Xin Fu.<br><br><i>(Shift to a wide, overhead shot of a beautiful, walled country estate with a lovely garden and many ponds. It is daylight. A shot of the gate tilts up to reveal a crest with a flying boar emblazoned upon it. Cut to the three kids spying on the gate.)</i><br><br><b>Aang:</b> That's the flying boar from my vision. Come on.<br><br><i>(The kids back away from their vantage point, then cut to a shot from inside the compound. Aang airbends himself over the wall, then Sokka and Katara climb over. They run across some open grass, then cut to a close up shot of a large bush. Aang's head pokes out below, then Katara's on top of his, then Sokka's on top. Each appears in rapid succession one after the other in a very "Scooby-Doo" like fashion. </i><br><br><i>Suddenly a huge surge of earth throws them all into the air. They yell as they fall land unceremoniously, Sokka onto the ground and Aang and Katara into nearby bushes.
