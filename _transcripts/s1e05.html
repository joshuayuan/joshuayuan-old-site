The shot pans up to reveal the Katara, Aang, Sokka and Appa mounting the crest of a small hill. Aang smiles and spreads his arms wide.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: The Earth Kingdom city of Omashu!<br><br><i>(Cut during Aang's statement to a wide shot of the valley in front of them. A walled city rests atop a huge rock promontory and is accessible only by a narrow, switchback road. The city looks both impressive and impregnable. Cut back to the group.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: I used to always come here to visit my friend, Bumi.<br><b>Katara</b>: Wow. We don't have cities like this in the South Pole.<br><b>Sokka</b> <i>(in amazement)</i>: They have buildings here that don't melt!<br><b>Aang</b>: Well, let's go slow pokes! The real fun is inside the city!<br><br><i>(Aang launches himself into the air and lands farther down the hill.)</i><br><br><b>Katara</b>: Wait, Aang! It could be dangerous if people find out you're the Avatar.<br><b>Sokka</b>: You need a disguise.<br><b>Aang</b>: So, what am I supposed to do? Grow a mustache?<br><br><i>(Cut to Aang wearing a huge fake head of hair and mustache made out of some of Appa's hair. He is scratching underneath the wig.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: Ohh, this is so itchy! <i>(To Appa)</i> How do you live in this stuff? <i>(Appa grunts at him in response.)</i><br><b>Sokka</b>: Great! Now you look just like my grandfather.<br><b>Katara</b>: Technically, Aang is 112 years old.<br><b>Aang</b> <i>(picking up his staff and using a fake, old man voice)</i>: Now let's get to skippin', young whippersnappers! The big city awaits.<br><br><i>(Aang begins to walk hunched over, using his staff as a walking stick. Fade to a shot sometime later of the three walking up the access road.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: You guys are gonna love Omashu. The people here are the friendliest in the world.<br><br><i>(From o.c. a rough voice is heard. The three stop short at the sound, and the shot cuts a moment later to a view of the city gate just up ahead. A merchant is trying to get into the city, but the three guards are giving him trouble.)</i><br><br><b>Gate Guard</b>: Rotten cabbages! What kind of slum do you think this is?<br><br><i>(Cut to a closer shot of the guards and the merchant. The guard is holding one of the offending cabbages. He crushes the cabbage in his hand, knocks those in the merchant's arms over the side of the access road. The guard then earthbends a lump of the ground, knocking the merchant's cabbage cart high into the air and over the side of the access road. The cart and all the merchant's cabbages plunge hundreds of feet to the valley floor below.)</i><br><br><b>Cabbage Merchant</b>: Noo! My cabbages!<br><br><i>(The merchant looks over the side of the road as he laments. The camera pans left to our group as they look over as well. Cut to the three now looking ahead to the gate with some trepidation.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: Just keep smiling...<br><br><i>(Aang walks forward with a big smile. Katara titters uneasily, but she and Sokka follow. The guard who has just obliterated the cart walks forward to meet Aang. He earthbends a huge boulder out of the ground and holds it over Aang's head.)</i><br><br><b>Gate Guard</b>: State your business!<br><br><i>(Aang rushes forward out from under the rock in a move much too sprightly for his supposed age. He points an accusing finger at the guard and using his old man voice begins to speak.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: My business is my business, young man, and none of yours! I've got half a mind to bend you over my knee and paddle your backside!<br><br><i>(The guard drops the stone behind Aang in surprise. Cut to view of Katara and Sokka, both terrified at what Aang is doing.)</i><br><br><b>Gate Guard</b>: Settle down, old timer. Just tell me who you are.<br><b>Aang</b>: Name's Bonzu Pipinpadaloxicopolis, the Third, and these are my grandkids.<br><b>Katara</b> <i>(now smiling serenely)</i>: Hi, June Pipinpadaloxicopolis. Nice to meet you.<br><b>Gate Guard</b> <i>(pointing to Katara)</i>: You seem like a responsible young lady. See that your grandfather stays out of trouble. Enjoy Omashu!<br><b>Katara</b>: We will.<br><br><i>(The guard motions them to pass. The three walk forward into the city with Sokka trailing.)</i><br><br><b>Gate Guard</b>: Wait a minute! <i>(He grabs Sokka by the shoulder just after he passes.)</i> You're a strong young boy. Show some respect for the elderly and carry your grandfather's bag.<br><b>Aang</b>: Good idea! <br><br><i>(Aang throws bag to Sokka. Cut to a rear shot of the three at the gate, which is stone and consists of three movable, interlocking stone walls. The three are shocked by the size and power of this fortification. The gates begin to close again as the three move to pass through it. Just as his vision of Aang is obscured, the guard sees Momo's ears emerge from Aang's wig. Cut to a shot of three inside the gate and looking over a railing at the interior of the city. The shot pans up to reveal many houses with roofs painted in Earth Kingdom green. There are chutes all over the city with crates and packages sliding along them. While Aang is speaking, the view cuts to images of earthbenders working the delivery system as Aang explains the mechanics of the system to Katara and Sokka o.c.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: This is the Omashu delivery system. Miles and miles of tubes and chutes. Earthbending brings the packages up and gravity brings them down. <i>(Cut back to the group.)</i><br><b>Sokka</b>: Great, so they get their mail on time.<br><b>Aang</b>: They do get their mail on time, but my friend Bumi found a better use for these chutes...<br><br><i>(Aang smiles mischievously, looking slightly o.c. Fade to a flashback scene. A young boy with spiky orange hair tied with a headband looks out over the city. Aang's torso appears on the left side of the screen and the boy turns to face him. The boy, Bumi, has a missing tooth and a slightly insane facial expression.)</i><br><br><b>Bumi</b>: Look around you, what do you see?<br><b>Aang</b>: Umm... the mail system?<br><b>Bumi</b> <i>(conspiratorially)</i>: Instead of seeing what they want you to see, you gotta open your brain to the possibilities.<br><b>Aang</b>: A package sending system?<br><b>Bumi</b>: The world's greatest super slide!<br><br><i>(Cut to a wide shot of the top of the chute they are looking at. The shot expands to show that is does look like a huge slide. Cut back to the pair.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: Bumi, you're a mad genius!<br><br><i>(Cut to Bumi, who smiles widely, laughs and snorts. Cut to Aang and Bumi in one of the transport bins rocketing down the slide. The flashback ends, but it is clear that Aang, Katara and Sokka are now at the same place in the city where the flashback occurred. The view pans up to the top of the slide where the three are now sitting one of the transport bins, teetering. Aang is excited, the other two are leery.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: One ride, then we're off to the North Pole, Airbender's honor.<br><b>Katara</b>: This sounded like fun at first, but now that I'm here, I'm starting to have second thoughts!<br><br><i>(As Katara finishes her sentence the view cuts to an overhead shot that shows the initial vertical drop. It is intimidating. As she finishes, the bin drops into the chute and they rocket away. As the accelerate down the chute, a neighboring chute becomes visible in the background. It is clearly going to merge with the chute our group is in. A rack of spears is dropping down this other chute and after the two paths merge, Sokka is soon ducking to avoid getting killed. Katara and Sokka start making distressed noises as they try and avoid the spears.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: I'm on it! I'm on it!<br><br><i>(Aang starts rocking the bin back and forth in the chute. He soon derails them out of the chute and their bin freefalls onto a rooftop below. Cut to a view of a group of Earth Kingdom soldier being addressed by an officer.)</i><br><br><b>Officer</b>: Men, you'll be going off to combat soon. It's important that you be prepared for anything.<br><br><i>(At this moment, the bin with our group falls into view, shocking the audience. The frame stops with the accompanying sound effect of an egg-timer going off.. Aang has grabbed the front of the bin and is apparently trying to pull it up, his foot in Katara's face. Sokka is panicking in the back. The frame rate speeds up again as Aang airbends to propel the bin back into the air and out of the screen. Within a shot or two they have managed to drop back into a chute and are rocketing down once again.)</i><br><br><b>Katara</b>: Aang, do something! Use your airbending!<br><b>Aang</b>: Yeh! Good idea! That'll make us go even faster!<br><br><i>(Aang blasts air behind them, making them speed up. Cut to city dwellers looking at them in alarm as they whiz by down the chute. As they approach the drop down of the last major chute, they all screen as they see the off-load point just in front of them. The off-load has a package on it that they will hit. An earthbender next to it moves the package. Cut to the kids, who breathe a sigh of relief. Cut back to the earthbender, who raises another package into the off-load point. Cut back to the kids, who scream again. Rather than hit the package, they hit the side of the trench and run off the track again. They all fall out of the bin and are falling, but Aang airbends them each back into the bin. They bounce off a roof and into a man's work room, destroying his pottery. They bounce of his floor and out the window opposite the one they came in.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: Sorry!<br><br><i>(They drop into someone's living room and fly through their house. Outside they crash through the wall of the balcony and drop again, screaming. Cut to the merchant from the earlier scene, fondly shaking one of his cabbages. The sound of a bomb falling is heard. He looks up and jumps back as the bin and the kids fall onto the cabbage cart, totally destroying it, blowing cabbages all over the place. The kids land in a heap and Aang's disguise is now gone.)</i><br><br><b>Cabbage Merchant</b>: My cabbages! You're gonna pay for this!<br><br><i>(The three are quickly surrounded by soldiers.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b> <i>(sheepishly)</i>: Two cabbages please.<br><br><i>(Fade to scene of King Bumi's throne chamber. It is decorated in shades of Earth Kingdom green. The aged King sits on his throne in the distance, for it is a large room. Cut to the King, who wears the same crazy expression as in Aang's flashback, though he is now clearly ancient. The King looks upon the three, and the guards behind them force them to kneel.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: Mmm?<br><b>Guard</b>: Your majesty, these juveniles were arrested for vandalism, traveling under false pretenses and malicious destruction of cabbages.<br><br><i>(Screen pans right to reveal the irate cabbage dealer.)</i><br><br><b>Cabbage Merchant</b>: Off with their heads! One for each head of cabbage!<br><b>Guard</b>: Silence! Only the King can pass down judgment. What is your judgment, Sire?<br><br><i>(Close up of King Bumi. He looks at each in turn. Sokka is nervous, Katara hopeful, and Aang tries to act like he's invisible.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: Throw them... a feast!<br><br><i>(Guards make noises of surprise, the merchant of chagrin. Carnival music plays in the background.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: Huh?<br><br><i>(Fade to a table loaded with food, camera pans right. Momo eats goodies on the right side of the table. Cut to the three seated, with Aang in the middle. Behind them King Bumi stands.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: Heheh! The people in my city have gotten fat from too many feasts, so I hope you like your chicken with no skin.<br><b>Aang</b>: Thanks, but I don't eat meat.<br><b>King Bumi</b> <i>(to Sokka)</i>: How about you? I bet you like meat. <i>(He sticks the drumstick in Sokka's mouth.)</i><br><b>Sokka</b> <i>(chewing)</i>: Mmm!<br><b>Katara</b> <i>(to Aang)</i>: Is it just me, or is this guy's crown a little crooked? <br><br><i>(She makes cukoo motions at the side of her head as she says the latter. Cut to King Bumi moving to take his seat at the opposite end of the table.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: So, tell me young bald one. Where are you from?<br><b>Aang</b>: I'm from... Kangaroo Island.<br><b>King Bumi</b>: Oh, Kangaroo Island, eh? I hear that place is really hoppin!<br><br><i>(Cut to the three. Silence is broken by Sokka's laughter, the other two look at him like he has grown a third head.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka</b>: What? It was pretty funny.<br><b>King Bumi</b> <i>(yawns)</i>: Well, all these good jokes are making me tired. Guess it's time to the hay.<br><br><i>(As he ends his sentence, he suddenly throws another drumstick at Aang, who airbends it to a standstill, though he is very surprised. It spins in the air in front of him. The guards draw breath in surprise.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: There's an airbender in our presence and not just any airbender, the Avatar! <i>(He stands. Aang drops the drumstick, trying to act like he did not just reveal himself.)</i> Now what do you have to say for yourself, Mr. Pipinpadaloxicopolis?<br><br><br><br><u><b>Act II</u></b><br><br><i>(Long shot of the city, cut back to the feast table. Aang stands and spreads his arms wide in a gesture of defeat.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: Okay! You caught me. I'm the Avatar, doing my Avatar thing, keeping the world safe. Everything checks out <i>(looks under the table)</i>, no firebenders here. So, good work everybody. <i>(Puts his arms around his companions and together they stand.)</i> Love each other, respect all life and don't run with your spears. We'll see you next time!<br><br><i>(The three have been walking backwards to the door, but the guards stop them. The shot widens to show the back of King Bumi in the foreground looking at them.)</i><br><br><b>Katara</b>: You can't keep us here. Let us leave.<br><b>King Bumi</b>: Lettuce leaf? <br><br><i>(He picks up a lettuce leaf from the plate in front of him and takes a bite. Cut to the three as Sokka leans over to speak in a low voice to the others. The carnival music has begun to play in the background.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka</b>: We're in serious trouble. This guy is nuts.<br><b>King Bumi</b> <i>(now very serious, the music stops)</i>: Tomorrow the Avatar will face three deadly challenges. But for now, the guards will show you to your chamber.<br>Guard: My liege, do you mean the good chamber, or the bad chamber?<br><b>King Bumi</b>: The newly refurbished chamber.<br><b>Guard</b>: Wait, which one are we talking about?<br><b>King Bumi</b>: The one that used to be the bad chamber, until the recent refurbishing that is. Of course, we've been calling it the new chamber, but we really should number them. Uh, take them to the refurbished chamber that was once bad!<br><br><i>(Cut to the three being led out by guards, then a close up of King Bumi looking mad and chomping on lettuce. Cut to a wall that is torn open by earthbending. The three are thrust in and the “door” is closed by earthebending. The chamber is beautiful, spacious and furnished with three comfortable beds.)</i><br><br><b>Katara</b>: This is a prison cell? But it's so nice.<br><b>Aang</b>: He did say it was newly refurbished.<br><b>Sokka</b>: Nice or not, we're still prisoners.<br><b>Aang</b>: I wonder what these challenges are gonna be.<br><b>Katara</b>: We're not sticking around to find out. There's gotta be some way outta here.<br><b>Aang</b> <i>(smiling and pointing o.c.)</i>: The air vents!<br><b>Sokka</b>: If you think we're gonna fit through there then you're crazier then that king.<br><br><i>(Cut to view of the air vent. It is a small circular hole in the wall.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: We can't, but Momo can.<br><br><i>(Cut to view of Momo sprawled on the bed, gorged on an apple, his tongue still licking the fruit. The shot expands to show Aang entering from the right.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: Momo, I need you to find Appa and bust us outta here!<br><br><i>(Camera switches to a view from inside the air vent. The light from the room is blocked as Aang stuffs Momo face first into the vent. Soon Momo's face is right up against the camera. Cut to shot of Aang stuffing the little animal into the vent and having some trouble.)</i> <br><br><b>Aang</b>: Go on, boy, get Appa!<br><br><i>(He stops, only to have Momo's behind dangle from the vent. He is stuck.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka</b>: Eh, how was Appa supposed to save us anyway?<br><b>Aang</b> <i>(from o.c., as Momo tries to free himself, but fails)</i>: Appa is a ten ton flying bison, I think he could figure something out.<br><b>Katara</b>: Well, no point in arguing about it now. <i>(She gets in a bed.)</i> Get some rest, Aang. Looks like you'll need it for tomorrow.<br><br><i>(Aang walks dejectedly over to the last unoccupied bed. Fade to a shot of Aang asleep, snoring loudly. The room shakes as an earthbender opens the “door.” Aang opens his eyes to see the other beds empty.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: Sokka! Katara! <i>(Turning to guards)</i> Where are my friends?<br><b>Guard</b>: The King will free them if you complete your challenges.<br><b>Aang</b>: And if I fail?<br><b>Guard</b>: He didn't say. Your staff please?<br><br><i>(Aang gives the staff to the guard. Cut to Aang entering the throne room flanked by two guards. King Bumi's torso appears on the left side of the screen. He is wearing a horrible, blue, purple and light green robe.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: First, Avatar, what do you think of my new outfit? I want your honest opinion. <br><br><i>(Cut to Aang who has no reaction. A cough is heard in the background. Cut back to the King.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: I'm waiting.<br><b>Aang</b>: I... guess it's fine.<br><b>King Bumi</b>: Excellent! You passed the first test.<br><b>Aang</b>: Really?<br><b>King Bumi</b> <i>(thinking)</i>: Well, not one of the deadly tests. The real challenges are much more... challenging.<br><br><i>(Aang's expression becomes angry. He airbends his feet to run in an instant up to King Bumi.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: I don't have time for your crazy games! Gimme my friends back! We're leaving!<br><b>King Bumi</b>: Ohh, I thought you might refuse... <br><br><i>(Cut to a shot with the King on the left, Aang on the right, and a view of the wall of the chamber between them. At this moment a “door' is opened by guards holding Katara and Sokka in the corridor beyond. The guards place small rings on one of their fingers which contract to fit snugly as soon as they are worn. Sokka and Katara struggle to take off the rings, but can't.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: ...so I will give your friends some special souvenirs. Those delightful rings are made of pure genemite, also known as creeping crystal. It's crystal that grows remarkably fast. By nightfall your friends will be completely covered in it. Terrible fate, really. I can stop it, but only if you cooperate.<br><br><i>(Close up of the ring on Sokka's finger. It grows in front of the camera. Cut to Sokka's face.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka</b>: Ah! It's already creeping!<br><b>Aang</b> <i>(to King Bumi)</i>: I'll do as you want.<br><b>King Bumi</b> <i>(grinning evilly)</i>: Mmm!<br><br><i>(Fade to new scene of a cavern. Camera pans left to reveal Aang standing on a small stone parapet with a waterfall in the background. The cavern floor is covered in stalagmites. In the upper left corner of the screen, King Bumi, the guards and the prisoners stand on a balcony. Crystal already covers the forearms of both. King Bumi laughs.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: It seems I've lost my lunch box key and I'm hungry.<br><br><i>(Cut to a close up shot of a key hanging by a long chain in the middle of the waterfall. A ladder reaches up from the ground of the cavern to about where the key dangles.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: Ooo, there it is. Would you mind fetching it for me?<br><br><i>(Aang jumps into action. Using his airbending skills he bouces from stalagmite to stalagmite. He charges into the waterfall, holding his breath, and begins to climb the ladder. The force of the water stops him from making progress, though.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: Ooo, climbing the ladder. No one's thought of that before.<br><br><i>(Aang loses his grip and is shot out of the waterfall. He is about to get impaled when he recovers and slides between two stalagmites, one foot on the side of each. He breathes a sigh of relief. He looks up at his friends and regains his determination. This time he flies up to the stalactites on the ceiling and is soon looking down at the key. He concentrates, jumps into the waterfall, and is shot right back out, managing to grab onto a stalagmite. Cut to King Bumi and the prisoners. The crystal now covers them up to the shoulder.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: That's right. Keep diving head in, I'm sure it'll work eventually.<br><br><i>(This gives Aang an idea. He breaks off the top of the stalagmite he is holding and throws it at the chain holding the key. Using his airbending skills he makes sure it breaks the chain and carries the bottom part of it along with the key up to the balcony. The tip of the stalagmite embeds itself like a spearhead into the top of the doorway. The key now dangles just over the surprised King's head.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: There, enjoy your lunch! I want my friends back, now!<br><b>King Bumi</b>: Uh, not yet. I need help with another matter. It seems I've lost my pet Flopsy.<br><br><i>(Cut to a fluffy bunny sitting on a rock. The scene expands to show Aang landing in the background.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: Okay, found him!<br><br><i>(The view expands again to reveal Aang and the bunny in the middle of a shallow arena. King Bumi and the prisoners are at the railing around the top of the arena.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: Bring him to me! Daddy wants a kiss from Flopsy!<br><br><i>(Cut to Aang and Flopsy. Behind Aang a huge monster is landing.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: Come here, Flopsy!<br><br><i>(Aang turns around to face the monster while the bunny squeaks and runs off. The monster crushes a huge boulder in front of Aang. He flips backwards and lands as the bunny runs by him, squealing in terror.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: Flopsy, wait! Flopsy! Flopsy!<br><br><i>(Aang chases the bunny while the monster chases Aang. Cut to King Bumi, who is cackling maniacally. The bunny runs into a rabbit hole in the wall of the arena. Aang slides up next to it and sticks his hand in the hole. He rummages around, but finds nothing. Meanwhile, the monster closes in. Aang has another idea. He stands up and faces the monster just as it arrives.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b> <i>(to monster)</i>: Flopsy?<br><br><i>(The monster stops instantly and wags its tail. Flopsy picks Aang up tenderly, making gentle noises. Aang is surprised and starts screaming. He stops when Flopsy gives him a huge lick.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: Flopsy! <br><br><i>(He rubs Flopsy's head. Flopsy's drops Aang and scales the arena wall in response to King Bumi's o.c. whistling and kissing noises. He flops on back in front of King Bumi. Carnival music begins to play.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: Awww, that's a good boy! Yes, who has a soft belly? <br><br><i>(He begins to rub Flopsy's belly. Flopsy's left leg paws the ground in pleasure. Cut to Aang jumping up onto the railing of the arena. Katara is in the foreground, covered from head to ankle in crystal. The carnival music stops.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: Guys, are you ok?<br><b>Katara</b>: Other than the crystal slowly encasing my entire body, doing great.<br><br><i>(Camera pans right to Sokka who is in similar straits. A new length of crystal grows on the left side of Sokka's head. He loses his balance and keels over. Cut to King Bumi rubbing Flopsy's belly.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: Awww, yes.<br><b>Aang</b> <i>(looking severe)</i>: Come on. I'm ready for the next challenge.<br><b>King Bumi</b>: Ahh! Hahaha!<br><br><i>(Fade to next scene with King Bumi still laughing maniacally o.c. The new scene is of an earthbending arena. It is ill-lit and largely featureless except the dirt floor. Cut to two balconies, Aang and King Bumi on one, the prisoners, now encased in crystal except for their faces and feet, on the other.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: Your final test is a duel and as a special treat you may choose your opponent. Point and choose.<br><br><i>(Two enormous gladiator type characters show up to flank King Bumi. The champion on the left is a muscular man with a nasty smile and a huge axe. The champion on the right is a mammoth fighter whoe looks like he relies upon brute strength. Aang is terrified.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b> <i>(thinking)</i>: So, you're saying whoever I point to, that's the person I get to fight?<br><b>King Bumi</b>: Choose wisely.<br><br><i>(Cut to Aang's p.o.v. as the camera ranges between the King and the two champions.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: I... choose... you! <i>(He is pointing at King Bumi.)</i><br><b>King Bumi</b>: Haha! Wrong choice!<br><br><i>(King Bumi, with some effort, corrects his lumped posture. He dumps his robes to reveal a surprisingly muscular physique for such an old man. He is clearly formidable and Aang recoils, realizing his mistake. The King is also apparently a master earthbender, for he immediately stamps the ground, blowing Aang far out into the arena. He lands in the dust. King Bumi launches himself off the balcony and lands close to Aang. He laughs evilly as the scene cuts to commercial break.)</i><br><br><br><br><u><b>Act III</b></u><br><br><i>(Return to a long shot of the arena. Cut to King Bumi staring Aang down.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: You thought I was a frail old man, but I'm the most powerful earthbender you'll ever see.<br><b>Aang</b>: Can I fight the guy with the axe instead?<br><b>King Bumi</b>: There are no ‘take-back-sees' in my kingdom. You might need this!<br><br><i>(King Bumi motions to a guard who throws Aang his staff. King Bumi immediately launches several boulders at him which Aang dodges.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: Typical airbender tactic: avoid and evade. I'd hoped the Avatar would be less predictable.<br><br><i>(He launches another boulder at Aang, who dodges and launches himself into the air.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: Don't you have any surprises for me? Sooner or later, you'll have to strike back.<br><br><i>(The King launches another stone at Aang which misses, but explodes upon impacting the ceiling of the arena. The debris knocks Aang to the ground and he loses his staff as he falls. Aang gets back up as King Bumi begins walking around. With each turn he makes a huge pillar of rock block Aang's path. One of them catches Aang in the gut as it rises into the air.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: Oh, you'll have to be a little more creative than that!<br><br><i>(Aang jumps off the pillar, riding one of his famous airballs. He rides the wall of the arena and approaches the King from his right. He launches a huge gale at his opponent, who blocks it with a sheet of stone raised from the floor of the arena. Cut to the King emerging from behind the stone shield, a smile on his face. The carnival music plays again.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: Did someone leave the windows open? It feels a little drafty in here! <i>(Screen zooms to a close up of the King, who drops his smile.)</i> Are you hoping I'll catch a cold?<br><br><i>(Cut to Aang dropping off his airball and a quick cut back to the King, who kicks over the stone sheet and begins to raise it on earth dug out of the arena's surface. He shoots the earth underneath the stone sheet at Aang which knocks him over. The King strikes the ground with his fist, sending a shock wave through the arena surface right at Aang. The Avatar flips backwards and avoids the shock wave, but now is close to the rear wall of the arena.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: How are you going to going to get me from way over there?<br><br><i>(Aang looks determined and begins to run to his opponent. Cut to King Bumi who uses the side of his foot to dash the earth. The ground around Aang becomes quicksand and he falls in. The King raises two boulders and sends them to smash the struggling Aang. He escapes just in time as the rocks smash together. Aang jumps straight at his opponent, unleashing a blast of wind that knocks him and the stone sheet he stands upon back against the wall of the arena. The King raises one of the boulders from where he had just failed to crush Aang and pulled it back towards him at frightening speed. The Avatar sees it just in time and does a backflip that barely allows him to get up and over the flying boulder. The boulder of course moves on to almost crush the King, but he breaks it into many pieces as it reaches him. With tremendous effort, King Bumi tears the entire gate area of the arena out of the ground and holds it over his head. Aang screams in terror and begins to run in circles, creating a tornado. The King throws the massive earth mound, but the tornado grabs it and throws it back at him. As it reaches King Bumi he bisects it neatly in two. Aang appears between the rock pieces and pins the King with his staff. The King smiles and looks up. Cut to Aang who also looks up as a little piece of rock bounces off his head. Overhead hovers one of the two halves of rock, ready to crush them both.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: Hehe! Well done, Avatar. You fight with much fire in your heart.<br><br><i>(The King throws the rock to the side of the arena. He then falls backwards into the floor, disappearing and leaving a Bumi shaped hole. Aang is flabbergasted.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: Huh?<br><br><i>(Cut to the prisoners. A hole opens up in the floor of the balcony and the King emerges, the hole closing instantly beneath him. Aang, using his staff as a helicopter blade, lands on the balcony.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: You've passed all my tests. Now, you must answer one question.<br><b>Aang</b>: That's not fair! You said you would release my friends if I finished your tests.<br><b>King Bumi</b>: Oh, but what's the point of tests if you don't learn anything?<br><b>Sokka</b>: Oh come on!<br><b>King Bumi</b>: Answer this one question and I will set your friends free. <i>(Cut to a close up of King Bumi's face)</i> What... is my name? <i>(Cut to Aang, who does not have a ready answer.)</i> From the looks of your friends, I'd say you only have a few minutes. <i>(Exit King Bumi.)</i><br><b>Aang</b>: How am I supposed to know his name?<br><b>Katara</b>: Think about the challenges, maybe it's some kind of riddle.<br><b>Sokka</b>: I got it!<br><b>Aang</b>: Yeh?<br><b>Sokka</b>: He's an earthbender, right? Rocky! <i>(Silence, followed by a cough in the background.)</i> You know, because of all the rocks?<br><b>Katara</b>: We're gonna keep trying, but that is a good backup.<br><b>Aang</b>: Okay, so back to the challenges. I got a key from the waterfall. I saved his pet and I had a duel.<br><b>Katara</b>: And what did you learn?<br><b>Aang</b>: Well, everything was different than I expected.<br><b>Katara</b> <i>(a piece of crystal growing into her cheek)</i>: And...?<br><b>Aang</b>: Well, they weren't straightforward. To solve each test, I had to think differently than I usually would. <i>(Realization sweeping his features.)</i> I know his name!<br><br><i>(Fade to the King's throne room. Aang and the King stand opposite each other. King Bumi is once again hunched over and in his regular green robes.)</i><br><br><b>Aang</b>: I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges. As you said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities. <i>(Cut King Bumi, who begins to laugh and snort, just as the younger version had in the flashback.)</i> Bumi, you're a mad genius! <i>(He runs and hugs the old King.)</i><br><b>King Bumi</b>: Oh, Aang. It's good to see you. You haven't changed a bit. Literally.<br><br><i>(Aang's old friend rubs Aang's head. Katara and Sokka approach from the left side of the screen, still encased in crystal. Cut to Katara's face, which is now all that is visible.)</i><br><br><b>Katara</b>: Uh, over here!<br><br><i>(Pan to Sokka's mouth, which is all that is visible of him.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka</b>: Little help?<br><br><i>(Cut to the King and Aang, the former of which makes a pulling back gesture with a fist, shattering the crystal from around both water tribe members. Crystal flies all over and King Bumi catches a piece.)</i><br><br><b>King Bumi</b>: Genemite is made of rock candy. <i>(He takes a bite)</i>. Delicious!<br><b>Katara</b>: So this crazy king is your old friend, Bumi?<br><b>King Bumi</b> <i>(annoyed)</i>: Who you calling old? <i>(Pause.)</i> Okay. I'm old.<br><b>Sokka</b>: Why did you do all this instead of just telling Aang who you were?<br><b>King Bumi</b>: First of all, it's pretty fun messing with people, hehe <i>(snort! snort!)</i>, but I do have a reason. <i>(Turning to Aang)</i>. Aang, you have a difficult task ahead. The world has changed in the hundred years you've been gone. It's the duty of the Avatar to restore balance to the world by defeating Fire Lord Ozai. You have much to learn. You must master the four elements and confront the Fire Lord, and when you do, I hope you will think like a mad genius! <i>(Cut to Aang, who smiles, clasps his hands together in thanks, and bows.)</i> And it looks like you're in good hands. You'll need your friends to help defeat the Fire Nation. <i>(Momo jumps onto Aang's shoulder.)</i> And you'll need Momo too.<br><b>Aang</b>: Thank you for your wisdom. But before we leave, I have a challenge for you!<br><br><i>(Cut to a shot of the city. Pan right to reveal a chute. A moment later a delivery bin flies by, King Bumi at the front, Aang in the back. Both are having a blast as the air rushes by them. Cut to long shot of the city where a plume of dust and smoke rises after an impact sound is heard.)</i><br><br><b>Cabbage Merchant</b> <i>(in anguish)</i>: My cabbages!<br><br><br><br>[End Credits]<br>
