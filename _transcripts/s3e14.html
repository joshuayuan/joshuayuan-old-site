(<i>Camera pans up to Zuko's face</i>) But hopefully I learned a thing or two. Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke? <br><b>Katara</b>: Sure. (<i>Cut to an overhead of the group sitting around a fire</i>)<br><b>Aang</b>: I like jokes. <br><b>Toph</b>: Bring it. (<i>Zuko stands up with his tray</i>)<br><b>Zuko:</b> Okay. (<i>Cut to Zuko kneeling between The Duke and Haru</i>) Well, I can't remember how it starts but the punch line (<i>the boys help themselves to the tea</i>) is, "Leaf me alone, I'm bushed." (<i>They give a dead panned look. Cut to show the rest of the group giving Zuko the same look as well</i>) Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it. <br><b>Katara</b>: Right. Maybe that's because he remembers (<i>grabs a cup</i>) the whole thing. <br><br>(<i>Aang laughs and helps himself to a cup. Cut to show the group laughing as well. Cut back to Zuko who smiles.</i>)<br><br><b>Toph</b>: It's nice to get a chance to relax a little. (<i>Zuko walks between Toph and Teo and hands them their drinks.</i>) It hardly ever happens. (<i>They proceed to drink their tea</i>)<br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>Cut to Sokka who is sitting by himself at the side, thinking</i>) Hey, can I talk to you for a second? <br><br>(<i>He gets up and walks away. Zuko places his tray down and follows. They walk to the area where Appa is resting.</i>)<br><br><b>Zuko</b>: So (<i>Appa wakes up and looks at them</i>) what's up?<br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>Cut to the side view of the area as they continue to walk further into the dark</i>) If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken? <br><b>Zuko</b>: What do you mean? Who was captured? <br><b>Sokka</b>: When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken. I just want to know where (<i>gestures both hands out</i>) they might be. <br><b>Zuko</b>: I can't tell you. <br><b>Sokka</b>: What? Why not? <br><b>Zuko</b>: Trust me. Knowing would just make you feel worse. (<i>He turns around and Sokka grabs his shoulder</i>)<br><b>Sokka</b>: It's my Dad. He was captured too. I need to know what I put him<br>through. <br><b>Zuko</b>: It's not good Sokka. <br><b>Sokka</b>: Please. <br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>closes his eyes</i>) My guess is... <i>(opens his eyes)</i> They were taken to the Boiling Rock. <br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>frowns slightly</i>) What's that? <br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>off screen</i>) The highest security prison in the Fire Nation. (<i>Sokka's mouth goes slightly agape</i>) It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake. (<i>Sokka turns towards the camera, folds his arms and looks serious</i>) It's inescapable. <br><b>Sokka</b>: So where is this place? <br><b>Zuko</b>: Why do you need to know? What are you planning?<br><b>Sokka</b>: Nothing. Boy, you're so paranoid. (<i>waves his arm dismissively</i>)<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>warily</i>) It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the Fire Nation. You guys actually flew right past it on your way here. <br><b>Sokka</b>: Thanks Zuko. (<i>yawns and pats Zuko's shoulder as he walks past</i>) Just knowing makes me feel better. <br><b>Zuko:</b> Yeah, I'm sure it does. <br><br>(<i>Cut to an area behind both of them as they walk back to the fire.

I'm gonna rescue my Dad. (<i>puts back his belongings back into his bag</i>) You happy now? <br><b>Zuko</b>: I'm never happy. <br><b>Sokka</b>: Look, I have to do this. The invasion plan was <i>my</i> idea. It was <i>my</i> decision to stay when things were going wrong. (<i>Cut to a side view of Sokka walking towards Appa as Zuko jumps off the bison</i>) It's my mistake and it's my job to fix it. (<i>Cut back to Sokka who looks determined</i>) I have to regain my honor. You can't stop me Zuko. <br><b>Zuko</b>: You need to regain your honor? Believe me, I get it. I'm going with you. <br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>Sokka climbs up near the saddle)</i> No. I have to do this alone. <br><b>Zuko</b>: How are you going to get there? On Appa? Last time I checked, (<i>Cut to a back view of Sokka</i>) prisons don't have bison day cares. <br><br>(<i>Sokka touches the saddle before he sighs and looks at Zuko.</i>)<br><br><b>Zuko</b>: We'll take my war balloon. <br><br>(<i>Sokka jumps off.

Gone fishing. (<i>Turns the paper and her head as she tries to decipher the handwriting</i>) Back in a few days. (<i>Aang turns around and yawns</i>.) Sokka and Zuko. One more thing. (<i>Cut to an area in Aang's sleeping bag as he walks back</i>) Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone. Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badger frog croak.

Oh, I didn't say anything. You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons. <br><b>Zuko</b>: No kidding. <br><b>Sokka</b>: Yep. A balloon. But for War. <br><b>Zuko</b>: There's one thing my Dad's good at, (<i>turns back to the tank and firebends</i>) it's War. <br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>nonchalantly</i>) Yeah, it seems to run in the family. <br><b>Zuko</b>: Hey, hold on. Not everyone in my family is like that. <br><b>Sokka</b>: I know, I know, you've changed. <br><b>Zuko</b>: I meant my Uncle. He was more of a Father (<i>Cut to Zuko who looks saddened</i>) to me. And I really let him down. <br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>emphatically)</i> I think your Uncle would be proud of you. Leaving your home to come help us, that's hard. <br><b>Zuko</b>: It wasn't that hard. <br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>Cut to a side view of the basket</i>) Really? You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about?<br><b>Zuko</b>: Well I did have a girlfriend. Mai. <br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>He goes closer to Zuko with a surprised look on his face</i>) That gloomy girl who sighs a lot? <br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut back to show Zuko grinning goofily</i>) Yeah. (<i>his face turns serious</i>) Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor. I couldn't drag her into it. <br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>Cut back to Sokka who leans back on the basket</i>) My first girlfriend turned into the Moon. <br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>looks up</i>) That's rough buddy. <br><br>(<i>Scene changes to night as the war balloon is still sailing in the sky.

Cut an area behind the balloon to show them nearing a volcano-like area with steam coming out from it.</i>)<br><br><b>Zuko</b>: There's plenty of steam to keep us covered. As long as we're quiet we should be able to navigate through it without being caught. <br><br>(<i>Cut to an overhead view of the steaming crater. Cut to the fuel tank's door opening and Zuko's hand appearing into screen, firebending into it. Cut to the burner as it flames weakly. Cut to show the war balloon slowly descending into the crater.

Cut back into the basket as it slants and Zuko loses his balance.)</i><br><br><b>Zuko</b>: So what are we supposed to do?<br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>Cut back to Sokka who grabs onto the tank</i>) I don't know. Crash landing?<br><br>(<i>Cut to show the war balloon dangerously near the water. Cut to show the basket touching the surface of the water. Cut back to Sokka as the water splashes onto his hand.

Cut to show the vent slowly deflating onto the broken strips of wood and metal. Zuko and Sokka gets up as he spurts out the stuff in his mouth. Both of them slowly turn towards the carnage</i>.)<br><br><b>Zuko</b>: How are we gonna get off the island if the balloon won't work? <br><b>Sokka</b>: We'll figure something out. I suspected it might be a one-way ticket. <br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>looks at Sokka as he walks away</i>) You knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway? <br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>Cut to a back view of Sokka walking towards the fallen vent</i>) My Dad might be here. I had to come and see. <br><b>Zuko</b>: Uncle always said <i>(Sokka proceeds to gather more of the vent and places them into the broken basket</i>) I never thought things through, but this, ugh, (<i>grabs his head)</i> this is just crazy. (<i>Cut to a front shot of Zuko as he throws out both arms</i>)<br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>Cut to an area inside the basket as Sokka turns back to Zuko</i>) Hey! I never wanted you to come along in the first place. And for the record, (<i>throws the fallen cloth into the basket</i>) I always think things through. But my plans haven't exactly worked, so this time I'm playing it by ear. So there. <br><br>(<i>He pushes the basket but yelps as his hand automatically withdraws since the basket scorches him. He proceeds to kick it. Cut to a side view of the broken balloon as it slowly sinks into the water</i>)<br><br><b>Zuko</b>: What are you doing? <br><b>Sokka</b>: It doesn't work anyway. (<i>Cut to an area behind their heads as both of them look at the vent slowly going underwater</i>) And we don't want anyone to find it. <br><b>Zuko</b>: I hope you know what you're doing. (<i>Both of them turn around</i>) There's no turning back now. <br><br>(<i>Cut to show a huge metal building hidden behind the steam.

Cut to the outside of the door to show 2 guys in prison guard uniform closing the door.)</i><br><br><b>Zuko</b>: I hope these disguises work. <br><b>Sokka</b>: We just need to lay low and find my Dad as soon as possible. <br><br><i>(The corridor is suddenly filled with running guards. Sokka and Zuko grin nervously, hoping that they won't be noticed.)</i><br><br><b>Guard</b>: (<i>stopping at the opening of the corridor to address the 2 boys</i>) Guards!

(<i>turns towards Zuko and Sokka</i>) Isn't that cute? (<i>He looks back at Chit Sang as the guys stare at him in silence. The guard senses something suspicious and raises his visor to inspect the boys.</i>)<br><br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Sokka's eye looks toward Zuko nervously</i>) Uh, yeah, very cute sir. <br><b>Sokka</b>: Super cute. <br><br>(<i>The guard smiles satisfactorily at their answers and walks back towards Chit Sang)</i><br><br><b>Bully Guard</b>: You didn't bow down when I walked by Chit Sang. <br><b>Chit Sang</b>: (<i>outraged</i>) What?

(<i>Cut to the warden</i>) I never thought I'd find you in here, <i>Prince Zuko</i>. <br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut back to Zuko's side view</i>) How did you know who I am? <br><b>Warden</b>: How could I not? (<i>furrows his eyebrows</i>) You broke my niece's heart. (<i>Cut to a side view of the scene to show Zuko leaning dismissively against the wall</i>.)<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>stands straight</i>) You're Mai's uncle? (<i>Cut to Zuko's guilty stricken face</i>) I never meant to hurt her. <br><b>Warden</b>: (<i>Cut back to warden and the camera slowly zooms in on him</i>) Quiet! You're my <i>special</i> prisoner now. And you best behave. If these criminals found out who you are, the traitor prince who let his nation down. Why, they'd tear you to shreds. <br><b>Zuko</b>: So what's in it for you? Why don't you just tell my Father and collect the reward. <br><b>Warden</b>: (<i>darkly</i>) Oh in due time believe me, I intend to collect. <br><br>(<i>He walks out.

You guys have met. <br><b>Suki</b>: (<i>Camera zooms out to show Suki and Zuko doing their chores</i>) A...actually, we met a long time ago. <br><b>Zuko</b>: We did?<br><b>Suki</b>: Yeah, you kind of burned down my village. (<i>looks at Zuko angrily as Sokka puts his hand on his helmet in a "You shouldn't have said that" gesture</i>)<br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>looks up and thinks</i>) Oh. Sorry about that. Nice to see you again. (<i>They put their mops against the wall as they sit down. Sokka checks his surroundings before joining them</i>)<br><b>Sokka</b>: So listen, I think I have an escape plan. (<i>faces the two and kneels while lifting his visor</i>) I checked out the Coolers again, the whole point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right? <br><b>Zuko</b>: Yeah... <br><b>Sokka</b>: So they're completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in. Well to keep the cold in it also has to keep the heat out, right?<br><b>Suki</b>: Just get to the point Sokka. <br><b>Sokka</b>: It's a perfect boat (<i>he left arm moves across his body in a fluid motion</i>) for getting through the boiling water. <br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut to Zuko and Suki who look at each other sceptically</i>) The cooler as a boat? Are you sure? <br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>Cut back to Sokka</i>) I'm telling you, it'll work. <br><br>(<i>Camera pans to the side quickly as it changes scene to Sokka walking around the perimeter of the Boiling Rock, near the water</i>)<br><br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>voice over</i>) I walked around the perimeter. There's a blind spot (<i>cut to Sokka's point of view as he looks up to see the guard tower slowly disappearing from sight from the area under the cooler building</i>) between two guard towers. It's the perfect launching point. I already tested it out. (<i>Cut to Sokka kneeling down. Cut to his hand letting go of a small boat made of paper</i>) We'll roll the cooler into the water and just float with the current. (<i>Sokka looks on as the boat sails with the current</i>) It'll take us straight across. As long as we don't make a sound, (<i>Cut back to present day Sokka</i>) no one will notice. And bing, bang, boom we're home free. <br><b>Suki</b>: But how are you going to get the cooler out? <br><b>Chit Sang</b>: (<i>off screen</i>) Yeah, (<i>Suki and Zuko are startled as they look up. The camera pans up to show Chit Sang eavesdropping on their conversation on the stairs</i>) how are you going to get the cooler out? (<i>He sails his body through an area underneath the railing and lands in a crouch near the group</i>)<br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>panics</i>) What? (<i >making various gestures</i>) We didn't. We... We didn't say that. (<i>waves arm dismissively) </i><br><b>Zuko</b>: Yeah, you heard wrong. <br><b>Chit Sang</b>: I heard you hatching an escape plan and I want in. <br><b>Zuko</b>: There's nothing to get in on. <br><b>Sokka</b>: Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is... an egg? (<i>Zuko and Suki sigh at Sokka's lame attempt to hide the truth</i>)<br><b>Chit Sang</b>: Ok, well, I come with you or the Warden (<i>Camera pans from Zuko to Suki who have serious looks on their faces</i>) hears about this <i>egg</i> too. <br><b>Suki</b>: (<i>looks to Sokka</i>) I guess we have no choice. <br><b>Sokka</b>: Okay, you're in. Now, first we need someone (<i>he reaches to his pocket</i>) to unbolt the Cooler. (<i >he hands a wrench over to Zuko</i>) From the inside. (<i>Zuko puts it into his pocket</i>)<br><b>Chit Sang</b>: (<i>Cut to Chit Sang</i>) Oh, I can get you inside. <br><br>(<i>Cut to 2 guards leaning on a railing overlooking the mopping area and talking to each other.

Hey, what are you, stupid (<i>grabs onto Zuko's shoulders and Zuko does the same as well</i>) Watch where you're going! (<i>They push each other and Chit Sang lifts Zuko off the ground and throws him. Zuko lands with a turn and faces Chit Sang.</i>)<br><b>Zuko</b>: Hey, you watch who you're shoving. (<i>he pushes Chit Sang</i>)<br><b>Chit Sang</b>: I think you mean <i>whom</i> I'm shoving. <br><br>(<i>They grab each others hands as they pretend to struggle. The other prisoners gather round and begin to cheer. They push each other before Zuko breaks off and attempts to throw a punch at Chit Sang.

Completely. <br><br><i>(Zuko shows the various bolts and nuts he unbolted.)</i><br><br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>smiles and lifts his visor up as he whispers</i>) I got Suki and Chit Sang out of their cells a few minutes ago. They'll be waiting for us at the shore. <br><b>Zuko</b>: Someone's coming. <br><br>(<i>Zuko pulls Sokka in and quickly slides the inner door closed.</i>)<br><br><b>Male Guard</b>: (<i>Cut to 2 guards making their rounds around the cooler corridor)</i> Yeah, new arrivals coming in at dawn. <br><b>Female Guard</b>: Anybody interesting?<br><b>Male Guard</b>: (<i>Cut to the inside of the cooler as the door opens by an inch to listen in to the conversation</i>) Nah, just the usual. Some robbers, (<i>Cut to the outside of the door to show Sokka's blue eye looking at the guards warily</i>) couple of traitors, some war prisoners. (<i>Sokka looks to Zuko</i>) Though I did hear there might be a pirate. <br><b>Female Guard</b>: No foolin'. <br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut to a concerned Zuko</i>) War prisoners. It could be your Father. <br><b>Sokka</b>: I know. (<i>looks away and closes his eyes</i>) <br><b>Zuko</b>: Well, what should (<i>shrugs)</i> we do? Are we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night?<br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>shakes head</i>) I don't know. (<i>looks towards Zuko with tears in his eyes</i>) Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom? All of our<br>freedom on the slim chance that my dad is gonna show up? <br><b>Zuko</b>: It's your call Sokka. <br><br>(<i>Cut back to Sokka who struggles to make a decision.

Rescuing your Dad is your chance. <br><b>Suki</b>: (<i>walks towards Sokka</i>) Your Dad? <br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>Cut to Sokka who looks up at them in desperation</i>) If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail. <br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>Cut back to Zuko</i>) No, it's not. Look Sokka, you're going to fail a lot before things work out. <br><b>Sokka</b>: (<i>stands up as he slings is bag over his shoulder while raising his eyebrows</i>) That's supposed to make me feel better?

(<i>Sokka stops in his tracks</i>)<br><b>Sokka</b>: Seriously, not helping. <br><b>Zuko</b>: (<i>grabs Sokka's shoulder</i>) You have to <i>try</i> every time.
