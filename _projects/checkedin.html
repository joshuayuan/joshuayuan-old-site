<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>CheckedIn is a mobile application developed in Meteor.js with Cordova plugins for Cal Hacks II. CheckedIn is an attendance taking application, which uses Bluetooth in mobile devices to check whether or not a user is actually present. If a mobile device is present within Bluetooth distance, then that user is presumed to be present. I was on a team with Bradley Chee, <a href="http://ziqichen.com">Ziqi Chen</a>, Billy Lu, and <a href="http://brentyi.com">Brent Yi</a>, and worked on the Bluetooth plugins. </p>
