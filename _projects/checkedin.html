<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>CheckedIn is a mobile application developed in Meteor.js with Cordova plugins for Cal Hacks II. CheckedIn is an attendance taking application, which uses Bluetooth in mobile devices to check whether or not a user is actually present. If a mobile device is present within Bluetooth distance, then that user is presumed to be present. I was on a team with Bradley Chee, Ziqi Chen, Billy Lu, and Brent Yi, and worked on the Bluetooth plugins. </p>
