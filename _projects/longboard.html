<h1 align="center" >Electric Longboard</h1>

<p>November 2015 – Present [In Progress]</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Turns out Berkeley’s campus takes a lot more effort to walk across than I expected. While walking is a great form of exercise, I’d prefer not to show up to class all out of breath and sweaty, so I could invest in a bike, or a longboard, but instead I went overboard and am currently building a customized motorized longboard. The idea is like this: get a longboard deck with trucks, get a motor, attach the motor to the wheels with a motor mount, pulleys, and a belt, connect the motor to an electronic speed controller (ESC), which should connect to batteries and an Arduino, get a battery management system (BMS) for balancing and charging the batteries, connect a wireless controller with the Arduino, and finally attach all these parts to the board! </p>

<p>Here are the features:</p>

<p>· 192kV Brushless Outrunner Motor with 36:17 gear ratio for top speeds of 22mph</p>

<p>· Two 5000mAh 3S 40C LiPo batteries for a range of 6 miles</p>

<p>· FVT 120A ESC, and Battman BMS by Raphael Chang</p>

<p>· Custom machined two-piece aluminum motor mount to allow for belt tensioning</p>

<p>· Kama Wireless Nunchuck Controller with WiiChuck Adapter to interface with Arduino</p>

<p>· Vacuum formed plastic enclosure, mounted on custom machined aluminum plate</p>

<p>· Caliber Trucks and a 36x9.5” longboard deck</p>
