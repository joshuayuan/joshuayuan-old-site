<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Drip is an Android mobile application to promote charitable giving. It monitors the user’s credit card transactions and rounds up each transaction to the next dollar value and calculates the price difference. This difference, or change, is donated to charities which you’ve selected. Tony Peng, Alex Shmakov, and I made this developed this application in native Android for Cal Hacks I, and won the “Best High School Hack” Award. I worked on the graphics and front-end side of this application. </p>
