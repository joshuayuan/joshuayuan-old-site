    <h2>Site Status</h2>
    <p>This website is currently still being designed and finalized, so a lot of the content is incomplete or erroneous and the overall design/layout may not be the most appealing, but that's because I haven't gotten to it yet.</p>
    <p>Please feel free to contribute to this site by sending me some pull requests (<a href="https://github.com/joshuayuan/joshuayuan.github.io">https://github.com/joshuayuan/joshuayuan.github.io</a>). </p>
    <p>A few things I plan to fix/complete/do:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make this site mobile friendly</li>
        <li>Fix project thumbnail images</li>
        <li>Reformat and add more content to project pages</li>
        <li>Fix weird spacings</li>
        <li>Probably change the colors</li>
        <li>Fix font sizes and colors</li>
        <li>Add more pages and projects!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So please remain patient, as this website will become a lot nicer in the upcoming weeks/months. Thanks!!</p>
